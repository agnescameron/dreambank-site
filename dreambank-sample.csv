9446,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,1656,1999-,2007-09-23,F,A,"I was looking at a detailed map of the city. It had the last names of the people who lived on each street printed on it where their house would be on the street. I was looking for my name at the end of Lakeland Dr. I was going to be moving back into the house that I used to own there. Connie B was living in the house next door, just as she did in waking life when I sold that house. I was talking to her, I think by phone. She was telling me how much free time she has these days and how much she would like us to get back to having coffee together frequently. She told me to come over most any time. It was a Saturday morning. I was thinking about the conversation I had previously with Connie, and considering walking over to her house to see if she was busy. I debated if I should call first, though we never used to do that. ",1FKA,
27016,toby,Toby: A friendly party animal,026,2003-2006,2006-05-05,M,Y,"I'm at another party. I've never been to the house before (but everything looks familiar). I'm sitting out on the deck in a plastic chair, wearing my gray zip-up sweatshirt and I'm drinking a bottle of beer. I'm the only one sitting down and there is lots of activity going on around me. Some really hot girls storm out the back door to leave and they all have pissed looks on their faces. My friend Mahorn intercepts them and says something, ""Before you go, let me just talk to you."" He takes them behind a corner. This girl Pattie (who I work with and who I know has a crush on me, but I don't like her) comes up to me and says something I don't remember, and I just ignore her. Then this one guy comes to the doorway of the back door and says, ""Hey, nice sweatshirt. You look like a fag!"" and goes back inside. I jump out of my chair and follow him. I corner him and say, ""What did you say?"" and now he can't remember and is just trying to avoid me. I follow him around the house asking him what he said until we bump into his twin, who gives me a big toothy smile. And I think, ""Oh no! this was his plan to take me to his twin, and now the two of them are going to beat me up!"" This makes me really angry and I grab the first one by the arm and put his head down so I can punch it. My direct contact sends him flying across the room. He lands on his back and slides into the kitchen wall and doesn't move. Now I'm in the kitchen and without a second thought, start beating on his twin until he too is on the ground. All the sudden Nick Smith (he was a senior in football when I was a junior) appears and says, ""Are we all fighting Toby? Well, let's go."" After a little scuffle, I beat him up. Then Ryan Jones (another high school football senior) appears and I knock him out with three punches to the face. I've had enough and start walking to the deck when this annoying girl Cindy runs up to me, grabs my hand and starts trying to lift it up and says, ""We have a winner."" But I look at her and say, ""Get the fuck away from me!"" I walk outside and there are two guys fighting each other. I don't know either one. Guy A breaks a bottle on Guy B and he falls off the deck. I go to the edge of the deck and look down in the street and they're still fighting. Guy A gets on top of a car and Guy B picks him up and slams him on his back. He looks really hurt. I run inside the house and yell, ""I need a phone. I need to call 911."" No one in the house listens and as I'm running around asking, I wake up.","2FSA, 1MKA, 1FKA, 1MSA, 1MKA, 1FKA, 1MKA",AN D
26382,sally,Sally: a forester,056,1983-2009,1992-02-16,F,Y,"I'm in Wisconsin.  I take a walk.  It's snowy, silent.  I go for a long walk.  Across a field, over a small ridge or embankment.  Snow everywhere.  I see my footprints in it.  I see a barn or house across a snowy field and go there.  There are horses in stalls.  Big huge horses.  They are willful and strong.  Stomping.  I watch them and somehow get caught between a wall and a horse coming in, just as the man I have come to visit comes in.  I am not too worried.  I just get out of the trap between horse and wall.  I talk with the man I came to see.  He is tall, strong, independent, authoritative, but playful too.  Reminds me of Larry W.  I decide to go back to my place or house.  Instead of experiencing the long walk back, I am immediately transported there.  I wondered about this.  Also I wondered about the ground I'd covered on the walk over - Did I go over the bogs?  Were they frozen?  Why didn't I break through into the bogs?  How deep was that snow?  I remember that walk as almost Russian - like - I was alone out in a snowy, flat wilderness, some trees far off, a wind, but all else silent except my footsteps.  Now I'm home.  The man comes in.  I have just come out of the shower.  I am in a towel and aware of my skin showing, glad it's smooth, the skin showing as I raise my arm, feeling sensual.  I am trying to adjust the towel and it won't clasp in the back.  A little later, the man is working at the floor.  The house I'm in is large, older, wood floors, interesting.  He is like a professor, or authoritarian.  I like him.  Mom is there, a few others.  I recognize the lowboy (furniture) from our (childhood) house, although it looks stripped and different, bigger.  The man is demonstrating something or questioning a problem.  A small drop of water appears by him and rolls to the right, under the lowboy.  It is dark blue and rolls like a drop of mercury.  We pick up an edge of the lowboy and look under it, wondering if the floor was slanted.  Then another drop starts from where the man is and rolls exactly opposite, to the left.  We all wonder at this.  Is the floor crooked?  Both ways?  We talk about measuring it.  Mom comes in with a right-angle measure.  I ask her for a level.  She remarks at that like it's a ridiculous idea, slightly chiding me.  We look to the man for explanation about the floor.  I look carefully at the floor, it seems slanted both ways.  This house seemed empty, like we didn't live there.  It was snowy all around outside.  Like that house in Dr. Zhivago, the cold and outside environment had all come in.  Feeling of open-mindedness, curiosity, questioning, learning, with this man.  Desiring something, like being part of his questioning and learning, discovering things, playfulness.  The atmosphere of the walk - snow/Wisconsin/northern was striking, unmistakable.","1MKA, 1ANI, 1FKA, 2ISA, 1FKA","HA D, CO D"

So I flew up and over their car. When I was flying along some high hedges, it dawned on me I was flying and a flying horse should come in. I went into the house and I tried to lock he door. It was like on 68 St. Then I tried it and it was still open. I pushed the button the other way, and still it was open. I pushed it shut and I noticed someone from the outside was forcing his way in. I held it back and yelled at Frank J. to get my shotgun. He was frightened and ran out. The crooks went to the other door, so I ran into the clothes closet and got my double barrel. It was a sawed off gun, to my surprise. I picked up two shells and put them into the gun. I noticed it was plugged up, but I opened the door and commanded them to beat it or I would blow their heads off. If they charged me, I would be out of luck for the gun would explode in my face. They walked off frightened and I was master of them. I came to a ghost town where everyone was a spook or dead person and alive again. One man jumped out of a window. He had tattooed arms and someone said, ""Look how he floats thru the sky,"" and he really floated at leisure in any direction he wished. I worked my hands and legs and I flew up, a boy spook got on my back and asked me if I would take him to the show. I rode him and when I flew into the show, it was full of ghosts sitting in the auditorium. I saw my family sitting in an upper corner. I was afraid for them. I flew down front and I saw Grandma Evans slumped in a seat. Her head was down on the floor. She was bent forward. I raised her up and I noticed she was headless. I asked her if the ghosts cut off her head and she said they did and promised not to hurt any of my family. Grandma did that just to save my family. I sat and watched a show. I saw Sid Hamlet.

27133,van,Van: a video gamer,002,2007-,2007-05-29,M,A,"I dreamed that I had just woken up in a hospital room. I remember snippets of the surgery. I had been badly hurt. A bullet, perhaps. It was in the same place where my appendix scar is. It didn't hurt yet, but I knew and wanted and was looking forward to painkillers. At my bedside was my mother. And in my bed was a girl who was beautiful, who said she loved me and that her name was Kimmi. A tooth of mine was loose also. I looked around. All kinds of stuff was strewn about the room. Spoils of some kind. The thing is, I didn't remember a single thing. I knew who my mother was, and later, who my friends and brother were when they came in, but the past -- I don't know how long -- was gone. I told Kimmi that I didn't know who she was and if I loved her. We snuggled close. I put my hand on her pajama-clad leg. I felt bad that I couldn't remember her. My mother accepted her, so I assumed they had met previously. Marvin, Kareem (friends from college), someone I didn't know and my brother Gerald came in. They were congratulatory. They were also giddy and laughed the laugh of someone who knows something that you should know but don't. Apparently, I did something completely badass and somehow got away with it. Kimmi was having a hard time coming to terms with my memory loss. My friends were making sexist remarks. I didn't know her, but I felt strongly for her and sorry for her. Her parents had warned her to stay away from people like me who would break her heart. She went to the bathroom to freshen up. She was strong, though. And pushed through the crap.  I also had a loose tooth. When it came out, it had a metal root, very futuristic. Like an implant.  I yelled because I wanted to share this with Kimmi. ""I feel like I am 10 or 12."" I tried to remember when my teeth last came out.","1FKA, 1FKA, 2JKA, 1FSA, 2JKA","SD D, SD D"

I'd met them randomly and offered to help. They're meeting me on the other side of the river. I was going to go first and check it out. Only way to get across is by floating/fording. The man had a black dog that brought people over with a small bark log raft. He swam it to us on the dock. We had to go one at a time. I wasn't sure it was safe, but went with it. I was wearing my white American apparel shirt, black shorts, and had my gear in a waterproof bag. I jumped in the water no problem. Halfway across, a ferryman took over from the dog and quickly rammed the thing through the water with a pole. We arrived at the dock and talked money. I thought he wanted 300 for each. I said, yeah, right. Then I said 25. He explained how that would leave him with nothing. Again, I thought he was talking individually. I gave him two 50s -- though they looked counterfeit that I got from Cambodia. He didn't seem to mind. I waited for the others to come back across, but they went to the gift shop to get clothes that could get wet. Across here was ""The New World"", owned by a big guy who was the boss of all these people. A female warrior chick on the other side explained to me how he wasn't a bad guy, but had issues.

228,alta,Alta: a detailed dreamer,226,1985-1997,1988-06-13,F,A,"I'm coming up to a sort of rocky ledge with a low (natural?) wall - all around there's sky, huge and beautiful. There's a mountain range in the distance. The colors are all yellowish and there's a sort of early-morning feel. It's not warm, but it's not real cold either. Somehow I know this either is Tibet, or we're coming to it. Down beneath the wall are a couple of flowers growing. They're very sturdy, thick-leafed, the kind of petals that start out green first, and shaped something like hyacinths. I think I'll eat one but I see it isn't fully developed yet. There's another, though, with a wider shape to it and quite thick (you might say meaty) rather than made up of lightweight petals, and I pull that and take bites of it. As I do (it doesn't really have much taste, by the way, but it's substantial) I find that buried in it is a small saucerlike bit of pottery, standard white-glazed with a flower pattern round the edge, much like diner dishes - I pull it out and see that it's the foot of a sort of vase or stemmed dish we'd found around here shortly before and we'd wondered where the foot was. It seems that the flower just grew around it. We go on. Soon we get to civilization of a sort. We're in a stairwell of a building I can tell is massive, and the scene is mostly dark, as if it were night, and we were seeing outside through windows, but we're not - on the left (facing down the stairwell) is a huge wall, and it shows a magnificent scene [although right now I can't remember what of, or even what it looked like - it may have even been an outdoor landscape, as if there were a window there. I halfway think the wall in front, on the stairwell, was indeed a window. But I'm not sure.] To the right is an open door into a lighted room, and people - not in large numbers - keep moving up and down the stairs and into and out of the room. They're all Orientals, these people, dressed in native clothes, the long coats, the hats with round stand-up brims, the slipper shoes. I'm aware that this place is equivalent in some respects to a shopping mall - of course, plain and simple, it is one, it has lots of vendors selling things that people want and need, all under one roof; but there's some fundamental difference in it, too. These people are taking the thing more seriously, for one thing. And it isn't set up intentionally for fun - though there are some neat things about it. The left-hand wall, for instance: at first I thought I was looking at (something, whatever it was!) really magnificent and elaborate. But now something has shifted - either it's done this on purpose, or my viewpoint has changed, but I see now that the whole thing is painted, an illusion. A bloody good illusion, but nevertheless not what I thought it was. Now that I know that, it bothers me - the whole situation bothers me. I'm not sure what to do next. At the same time, what's occupying my mind is the observation of this ""shopping-mall"" business. The idea of the mall is sort of ""new"" to us here, but when you think about it, there's nothing unusual about it except that we started building malls in places where there were already plenty of stores to be found. Elsewhere, stores are still grouped collectively for the convenience of the shoppers, but they have to come from farther away and do more business at a time. That's why there were fairs and street markets. It wouldn't be any sillier to build a regular mall in Tibet than in Texas, for heaven's sake. If people want to buy things, why wouldn't they do it in a mall just as easily as from rickety booths on the street? I'm on a city bus with several people from yoga class - I guess we've just left a class - including George and maybe Cynthia. I've got my purse and something else with me, which I stow on the seat. This is [another] ""funny"" bus - has its seats placed differently from regular buses, and it's up high like the out-of-town-coaches. We're all in a pretty fun mood, and we bowl along through a pretty part of town, with big trees and nice streets, older houses and occasional stores and offices. At one point the bus is diverted by road works from its regular route, and we turn to the left. Then, because of the diversion, we have to drive through a building - actually it's a lot like the Central area Pharmacy except it's got a garage attached. There's 2 sections to it. You can pull in the front or the back - the front is a bit more finished, with matching red brick to the store - you can enter the store from there. The back is different, with painted walls, a little more garage-like. The bus stops in the front; it's going to wait there to catch up to its schedule, and we all pile out of it to stretch our legs and look around. This is a place we know anyway, but it's neat. There's a sort of art exhibit in the back section, various things stuck up on the wall as if a children's school class had done them. Sue S is here (suddenly - I don't remember her being on the bus) and she's looking at them with us. And Tree is here, too - this place is only a short distance from where I live - on the street in back, matter of fact - and he's been exploring down here, I guess. He's come in the back door (both are open), and I pick him up and show him to the people. Actually I'm surprised he's letting me do that, and I'm keeping a good strong grip because he's beginning to get twitchy - but Sue and some others say, oh, what a pretty kitty, and I make up my mind to just go on home with him from here since we're so close, without waiting for the bus. I have to go back in to get my stuff, though. [And I suppose I put Tree down because he wasn't with me for the next part.] I climb up and go to get my purse and things, but while I'm here the bus starts to move. I guess it must have been left in gear or something because it starts going right on out and across the street (the entrance faces another street), and carries on for a couple of blocks. It stops eventually because it runs up against something, I guess, but it's a bit precarious. I can see that the street is going a bit downhill and if it starts to roll again it'll be hard to stop. I get out very carefully and go around to the front, thinking I might push it backward off of the incline, if I can (it's not such a big bus at the moment, you see - it seems like a possibility). But it's just barely starting to move again, and I give it a push, but no go - oh dear. I leap out of the way and remember I still haven't got my things, so I jump back on. The bus gathers momentum and rolls onward, down a street and around a curve and finally comes to rest somewhere, no particular damage done. I am joined now by a little guy in a rather exotic outfit - he's not quite midget-sized, but definitely well below average. (Rather good-looking though - dressed up sort of like, you might say, a warrior-elf. Maybe that's what he is. He's got on some sort of blue loincloth affair, and boots - dark hair, not too long - looks tough but still cute.) (I don't know where he comes from, but I'm not shocked to find him there - maybe he was hiding inside or something - I'm sure he didn't come in from outside.) We discuss the situation, which is more involved than it looks - we need to contact somebody for help. We can't handle this bus on our own (it's become something more like a spaceship now, and much larger), we know there's normally a crew of 2 men to run it, and we can't just leave it where it is and go. (I don't know why.) We poke around some, and find the radio to call the central-whatever with, and send a message to send help. That done, we banter around some more - this all seems like a rather fun adventure - and sort of get cozy. He proposes having sex, right there in the cabin, and I think it sounds like something of a lark, and say yes - I've never had sex with an elf before, for sure, and it might be very different, who knows? We've got nothing better to do till the rescue party gets here, although we don't know when that'll be. [Actually a fair amount of time has passed already.] Suddenly, as he moves over me lying on the floor, he gets bigger - much bigger. He sort of stretches out till he looms over me, and I don't like it. I say so, and next he reaches beyond me over my head to a shelf where he's put something to be handy. It's a kind of face-mask, only it's made of beads (not fine little round beads but cylindrical mostly, they're white and red, maybe orange and yellow too) and it fits over his chin loosely, like a beard. The look on his face has gone very serious, the way you do when the playful part of sex gives way to the other feelings. At that moment, the ""crew"" sent out from the central office arrives. We break apart in a hurry, as you might imagine, and explain who we are, and what happened. There are 2 men and a woman, they look very cold and matter-of-fact, but ask us to help (by doing something, but I don't remember what - it involves looking around the ""ship""). I go ""downstairs"" - toward the front of the place we're in - you might call it a cockpit - it no longer looks like a bus, there's a wall behind, very ""ship""-like - there are stairs, or a ladder to the next level. I hadn't even realized this was here. There's a bathroom down here, good, I need one, and go across the room towards it, but a man goes into it before me, so I have to wait. Now I'm confused. Who is this guy, and how did he get here before me? Is he one of the Tree that just arrived, and got here by another stair? Or has he been down here the whole time? If so, why didn't he say anything? Is he hiding? Oh, well, I'll just wait.","2JSA, 1ISA",

The basis for the choices varied between personal reasons, right and wrong, good and bad, socially acceptable or not, and morals and ethics. Most of the choices seemed to be about relationships or the choices were made recognizing the impact on some relationships or to avoid impact on some relationships. At times, it wasn't until after the fact that the impact on someone else was brought to someone's attention. Sometimes this resulted in them choosing differently the next time and others times the same choices were made. At least once the choice was simply to have a different attitude. Following that, the people involved were discussing how positively it impacted the entire scenario - something that was considered threatening, a monster, was now non-threatening and helpful. The entire planet was being wiped out by water in a flood type event. The water was dark, murky, and muddy. All of the survivors, most of the time, seemed to be on one ship.","2JSA, 1ISA, 1ISA",

It seems we have all moved into this old house, a two-story house, and my parents' bedroom was going to be downstairs and my bedroom upstairs. For some reason or another, this house was vaguely familiar to us. We were kind of worried about snakes or something like that. So we were downstairs and I or my father, I forget which, used the bathroom for something, to get a drink of water from the sink or something like that. There was a drain in the floor. I made sure that when we left the bathroom, we closed this drain, turning a little sort of valve on top of it and also after leaving the bathroom to close the door very tightly. Then we decided to go on upstairs to my bedroom for a while. At first we were in sort of a living room off my bedroom. Then we decided to actually go into my bedroom itself. My mother and I went into my bedroom. I guess I should say my mother-wife here, and my mother-wife who was more my wife now, was naked and climbed into my bed and I climbed in beside her and we curled around each other. My father was still out in the living room and it seems we had some sort of a dog too, something like a black cocker spaniel, sort of like Blackie in the Blackie pictures. The dog went out into the hallway and came yelping back. My father hollered that there was a big snake out in the hall. So I jumped out of bed and got a 22 caliber pistol out of the drawer by the bed, and incidentally I do own such a pistol, and ran out into the hall and this very huge snake was at the bottom of the stairs. It was dark in the hallway. It was night outside. So before I ran over to the stairs, I fired one shot down the stairs, randomly, to sort of frighten this creature. Then I ran over to the stairway and the snake was there. Part of it was buried into a crack on the side of the stairs and the other half was out exposed on the stairs. I emptied the revolver into the snake. One shot misfired, so I got about 4 shots into the snake. Then I took one other live round I had in my pocket and loaded that into the revolver and shot that into the snake, which by now had backed out of the hole and was opening its mouth toward me. It was about the size of a big boa constrictor, and I hit the snake with all my shots, but it didn't seem to have any effect on it, to speak of. The last shot was kind of funny, in fact, because it fired sort of slowly. Well, I slammed the door then and ran back into the room. I told my mother-wife figure and my father to grab our baby daughter and climb out of the window because we had to get out of the house. We jumped out of the window onto the fire escape and started climbing down the ladder. The others were kind of panic-stricken. I hollered to them to come on. This was no time to get upset and to give me our baby daughter since I was the best climber, and I could hold her and get down the ladder. So they gave me our baby daughter and I started down the ladder, and they came after me, and somehow we were in a tree now rather than on the fire escape. Somebody hollered to stop and here was a teenage boy coming, or rather standing around the far side of the house, calling to this snake as if he were a dog, and this big boa constrictor had come out as if it were really friendly. Then there were whole bunches of college boys on the lawn running around this snake and seeming to think it was something like a gag. I thought the snake was really quite sinister, and I thought these college boys were being misled by this boy who called the snake out originally. He was quite evil in his intentions and we weren't going to come down out of the tree until the police came. This boy -- I don't know who he was -- he seemed to have some connection with the people we bought the house from, whoever they were. So we all yelled so we could attract the attention of neighbors and get the police there.","1MKA, 1FKA, 1FKA, 1ANI, 1ANI",AP 1FKA+D

The whole place is open and people bustle around - though it's not crowded - I'm reminded of a newspaper. Anyway, I've caught him for a moment and explain how I'd like to combine the parking lists into one file (it seems he does something with parking himself and that contributes to it being awkward) so it can be a lot more efficient and easier to use. He's dubious about this, but says, yes, well, okay, I guess, we can do that...other kids, one girl, one boy. The girl was sitting at the desk before, (we're close to the left-hand wall) but got up a while ago, and I'm working with some stuff off to the left of it. It's awkward, and I move it up to the center of the desk and sit up at it. She's coming back, and I ask her if she needs to be here, but she says no, and I ask some question about what I'm doing and she helps me out. [She is or reminds me of somebody but I can't place her - I keep thinking of Gail , but it's more than that - probably a combination of people but there's something nagging at me about it. A particular name that should be there.] There's a computer here, she's been using it, and I think I'll poke at it a bit, but I can't get the hang of what she'd been doing. She shows me, it's something like, hit ""a"", then ""b"", then ""a"", ""b"" again, etc., then maybe ""c"", but I don't get it right. I'm frustrated. [ - the way I was over the dBase the other day, when I was wanting to do something with the parking lists.]I'm in a car, with a couple of other girls, on our way to a ""fair"" - seems like a State Fair, and we're going to be on ""team"" rather than just going to it. As we pull into the parking area for participants, we meet some others and get out of the car. Shortly a group of other vehicles shows up and blocks us in on all sides - the car, I mean - and when I want to get something out of it I can't get to it without climbing through a truck - I look all around and get thwarted each way, then climb through. Shortly after, I'm with several others in a place a bit beyond the cars, where we're hanging out and sitting around on various things. I'm on something suspended like a swing from some structure - it's not really supposed to be a swing but it moves like one and I'm just perched on it and getting it to move back and forth, it's fun - I keep going higher, possibly not a good idea - liable to knock into something. But I keep doing it, using body English to get it moving the way I want, and now I jog a little bit and start swinging in a wide arc to the left. I certainly didn't mean to be going this far, but I don't seem to be able to stop. I'm not going all that fast - as a matter of fact it's almost like slow motion - but I'm rather high up and there's nothing to grab onto or jump off onto. As I swing backward, I have to be careful not to slam into some screens that are on the back of where we are - there's a fence, but the screens form some sort of structure that would be quite awkward to explain if they got busted up. I can reach out and slow myself down and keep out from them, but I keep on going and bump into some other stuff all the way behind, and I come to the apex of the swing and go back the opposite direction. Coming back to the front, I go past where I started and swing over to the right, where I bump into a piece of furniture, it's like a sideboard/hutch or something, old, weathered, and I don't knock it down, but stuff on it, and maybe something next to it. Glenda is standing at it, she's doing some chore there or other, and she doesn't get excited or even react, but I know she doesn't approve. I just look at her sheepishly. Otherwhere [this may have been on the way to the fair, maybe not], I'm in a car, the place is in a town, an old place, very close in, very ethnic, a lot of adobe or some such substance. We get stopped by a cop* on some technical thing, and he lets us off with a warning after we explain it was something we didn't know or couldn't help. I can see across the intersection the tail end of a small parade, going down a sort of alley - walls on each side. What I see is some people dressed like Middle Eastern types, robes, turbans, sandals, and a donkey or two, with leaves or something hanging off of them. Later on, I'm in the car, next to the passenger door, somebody in between, my father's driving, and there's a couple of others in the back seat. We get stopped again by the same cop, he's tall, male, and black, a nice guy, sort of a park ranger type. (Probably not the same thing we got stopped for before, but also a technicality.) However, he's got to be someplace else, and he turns us over to another cop, who is a white, blonde woman with curly hair.","1MKA, 2JSA, 1FKA, 2FSA, 2FSA",AN D

When I came to places where there were homes I slowed down significantly. I realized that there might be cars pulling out of driveways without looking, or more importantly, that there might be children that run out into the road or across the road without looking first. I was out of my car in the grass and was watching two men playing together with their children. Each of them had one child. One child was a boy and the other a girl. They were hiding behind trees, pretending to have guns and pretending to shoot at each other. I found this very disturbing, that men in this day and age would participate in such play activity with their children. The one man and his daughter looked at me as though they wanted me to play along and I refused. I was talking to some other people, one in particular I know was a man. I was talking about something positive about my drive. I was holding a paper cup in my hand. He told me to watch out for something but now I can't remember what. I was skeptical about what he said. I was probably 95% sure that what he said was not true. As I was driving again I encountered what he had warned me about and realized that I should have been more trusting of what he said. It wasn't that big of a deal. It was more like something that was just an inconvenience as opposed to something that would hurt me, upset me, or cause me any kind of significant mental or emotional turmoil.","2JSC, 2MSA, 1FSA, 1MKA, 1MKA",AP D

8171,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,0381,1999-,2002-02-27,F,A,"I was with a large group of people. We went to a prison to do one-on-one counseling with prisoners. I didn't know all the people in the group. Terri O and Audrey T and Karen W were all in the group. We had car-pooled. When we arrived and went inside we had to walk along this ledge. All of the walls had a ledge just a few inches off the floor and only about 4-5 inches wide. We had to walk on this ledge rather than on the floor. We were obviously in single file. When we each came to the person that we were supposed to be counseling then we would go into that cell. We had to climb up into the cell with the prisoner. I was the last one to get to the cell of the prisoner I was going to be working with. I was in a section that was all women. I had past one cell and I thought I past the one I was supposed to go into. Since I wasn't sure I backed up and looked at a sign on the wall to double check. Then I went back and climbed up into the cell with the woman I was supposed to be counseling. There were two women prisoners in that cell. The woman that I was counseling was in the middle of a visit with her five children. I don't remember a lot about the counseling session. Going into it I was somewhat concerned about doing one-on-one counseling with a prisoner. I wasn't sure that I was ready or qualified to do counseling with a prisoner. When we were ready to leave we had to walk on these ledges again. This time, when we were leaving, we got separated. Some of us got lost and were having trouble finding our way out. There was one point that we were walking by the prisoners but they were no longer in individual cells. They were in spaces that remind me of cubicles. There were 6-8 prisoners per cubicle. Half on each side of the cubicle. There were no doors or bars on the end. We were at a higher level than they were so we could see down into the cubicles and see them. Occasionally there were some standing. We finally found our way outside, but we weren't all together. When my group got outside we realized that there had been a breakout. The prisoner's who had broken out had guns so I scrambled to get into a car with some of the other counselors. I think there were five of us in that car. Karen W was driving. We just kept telling her to drive faster. There was a lot of shooting going on. I thought we should all be crouching down in the seats so we wouldn't be hit by bullets coming through the windows. But I didn't say what I was thinking. We did keep telling Karen W to drive faster. I didn't understand why she was hesitant to drive faster. With all the shooting going on, there was shrapnel falling on the roof of the car. As it was falling it was disintegrating the roof of the car. It wasn't coming through the roof, but more like melting it. There was black matter dripping down and landing on us, in our hair and on our faces and sticking. I don't remember that it hurt but I don't think it was going to come off very easily and I think I was concerned about it leaving scars or injuries. Now I was trying to get into a car with someone else. I did. As we were taking off I saw Audrey T running to get into a car. I kept saying that we needed to stop and let Audrey T get in but they wouldn't stop. They said, no, we just need to keep going. I was very upset with them about this. Karen W was driving. This is confusing. She wouldn't stop for Audrey T to get in. We got away. I don't know who I was with. I was with two black women that I don't know. We were out in the country. We came to a place where. I think we went to each of their homes. Each of their homes was like a very small wooden shack. maybe 8 ft by 8-ft square. They were very run down and full of stuff. One of them just had a couple of people in it and the other one had people sitting along all four walls. I was lying out in the grass. I woke up. I couldn't open my eyes all the way or couldn't see clearly. It was kind of like when I wake up and am having trouble with my contacts because I need to put drops in my eyes. I got up and started walking and I could feel the grass under my feet and how rough or uneven the ground was. I bent over and felt the grass and thought, oh, I'm awake. I started walking and then I saw two men walking up behind me. They had been with us at the prison. Now, though, we were all dressed up. They each had on suits. I thought we were all awake.","2JSA, 1MOA, 2FOA, 2FOA, 2MOA",AP D
7706,ed,Ed: dreams of his late wife,078,1980-2002,1994-01-25,M,A,"I have just entered a building. It is cold and snowing outdoors. When I come indoors, a man takes my overshoes and says that he has prepared a surprise for me. I take a seat, then realize that I had had a dream of Mary. I want to record it, but my recording book is next door. I ask a girl to get it for me. She does so willingly, but only after she leaves do I realize that the weather is bad outdoors. When she returns with my notebook, I apologize for sending her outside not properly dressed for the bad weather. She says it's OK and tells me not to feel badly about this. When I take the notebook, I have trouble finding a blank page upon which to write. Someone asks me what I am doing and I reply that I'm keeping a record of my dreams of Mary. It seems I want everyone to know that I'm keeping such a record. Someone else asks me if I have to keep this record for my therapist. I answer that I am not seeing a therapist, that I am doing this for myself. As I write in my notebook (I must have found a blank page) I want everyone to see what I am writing. The book is open on my lap. I can't remember the number and date of the dream. This is because I don't have my regular recording notebook. I decide to go ahead and record the dream and to put in the number and date later, when I find my Dream Notebook. When I finally decide to start recording the dream, I can't remember what it was about. There are many people in this house or building. Everybody knows me, but I don't know them. The man who had taken my overshoes when I entered was very specific in asking for them. When he said he had a surprise for me, I assumed that it would be something to eat. And when I had asked for the return of my overshoes so that I could go get my notebook, the girl volunteered to go so that I would not have to go out into that bad weather.

I'm supposed to turn in a report of some kind, but I haven't done the work yet - I haven't had time. I need a piece of information, about how long was the average hospital stay of wounded soldiers in WWI (or is it II?), and I haven't found it yet. I'm in a room where I'm meant to be working, and not looking at books, but - as you know - if I see one I want to flip through it, see what it is. The book I've been looking at is open on the table - it's rather kid-oriented, lots of pictures and broken-up page formats, I look over the pages but I still don't see what I want. There's a lot of other books on this table, most of them old, looking like rebinds, I think they're all kid's books. I'm looking at the titles and find one that strikes me fancy, so I set it aside to look at later. [I'm not sure if it's that book or another, but I am looking at one more closely - it has to do with how to live with your family, in various situations - humorous style, like so many kid's books are in order to help get the point across.] I'm a bit frustrated, knowing I don't have time to get everything done and I'd rather just read for enjoyment. I realize I'll just have to be late with the report, it won't get done in time. Oh, I guess I could do the rest of the report without that information, but I want to get it all in having once thought of it. The old doubts creep in - am I indulging myself in perfectionism, or whatever it is? Do I have to do it thoroughly or not at all? Is it not all right not to do well? Or is this information really necessary and if I just applied myself wouldn't I get it right? Have I been lazy? Nuts. Anyway something different distracts me. Lisa's kite has gotten repaired and we're going to fly it. It's a standard kite-shape and blue - don't know what was wrong with it, but it was taken away for repair before we ever got it up and now this is a big event. I'm turning around and seeing that there are other people here, a fair number. We've gone into another room. This school is built like a stone park pavilion. It's a long open place with walls in between rooms but a walkway all along one (or both?) side(s). This, one end, is a kind of theater-room. It has a puppet stage and a couple of openings underneath it that lead backstage, they're curtained, one red, one blue, plain cotton, and an adult could get through them by getting on hands and knees. The people with me, it seems like they've come to observe or inspect something - we're facing the stage-end of the room. Without stage-sets or anything, you can see through to the outside. The rest of the room is empty except maybe for some props. There's a woman here, who looks something like Eleanor Parker - business suit, aloof, short hair, slightly disapproving, a taskmaster. There are a few people behind the stage. So the business of the kite comes up. People are gathering to see it go, and I'm wondering where Lisa is. Won't she want to be here? I see Becky come up, didn't she get Lisa someone to relieve her? Becky's looking very ritzy herself - hair in a classy knot on the back of her head. I go down the passage to see if I see Lisa - she's at the other end. For some reason I don't want Becky to know what I'm doing so I keep an eye out, and just casually step inside the room sideways rather than walking straight in. There's a lot of people in here - they seem to be at long benches crosswise in the room - I think they're all adults - it's not a class, exactly, but more organized than a library. Lisa is up at the front, helping people (pretty much as she does as a librarian), and I wave to her, mouthing the word ""kite"" and pointing. She sees and gestures a response - I guess she'll be coming when she can. I go back down to where we'll be flying the kite. There's a nice lot of people gathered, we're staying back under the roof of the building mostly, and looking out to where they've got the kite. It's a bare place with some ""dunes"", little hills, tufts of grass on. There's maybe 3 or 4 guys out there with the kite, very gung-ho. I notice Becky has her hair down now, I go back to an opening in a wall sort-of-place, where there's a bit of fence closing off the pavilion opening, and there's some bushes and other plants. I duck under and go up to the fence. There's another couple of people there, friends - one of them is a good-looking young man who's somebody's husband, and one of those people I privately daydream about. He's perched on a ledge and I go past him to my own position. Lisa still hasn't made it yet, but they seem to be determined to carry on anyway. The sky is clouding over, fast - it's getting darker by the minute and frankly even if it doesn't rain we won't even be able to see the kite if it gets up. But they're going on anyway. They start to run with it and bustle around, but can't get it up. Then I see a light, hear a click, don't know what it is at first - then I see what's happening. Since there isn't enough wind they're lighting a lighter underneath the kite to try to make hot air to lift it. This is stupid, of course, but I can't see any way of stopping them. What I'm afraid of is they'll set fire to the kite. I remark as much to my friends. They don't stop, of course, and the sky gets blacker and stormier and they disappear behind a dune on the left and there's a ""pfft"" sound that I recognize. It's the kite going up, of course, and that's all she wrote. There won't be anything left to save - that kind of flimsy paper just goes all at once. What a drag after all that work. Damn. And Lisa still isn't here, doesn't have any idea what happened. Blah. So we all start away from where we're watching, and wander on back to wherever.","2JOA, 1FKA","AN D, CO D"

They are walking, outside in a downtown area, where there's crowds of people, so the bad guy can't just run after the other and shoot him down. But he's getting closer. At one point the good guy struts across an intersection to fit in with other people, and the bad guy does the same. Finally the bad guy really does catch up, and turns the other to face him. The good guy seems a little bit nervous, but you can see he's trying to look at ease and amused. Typical adventure hero. He takes the gun the bad guy's holding, not out of his hand, but with his hand and moves his whole arm around some way that resembles locking arms to drink champagne romantically. Ends up with the gun pointed at his own cheek.

First I was in Mexico at the beach and stuck on some sort of movie set. Some blond girl was running around for a scene, so all the exits were closed off so people wouldn't come in. For some reason, I was trapped on the wrong side of this barrier, and all I wanted to do was go back to the beach. It was so warm and sunny that I was almost shocked when I woke up that I wasn't in Mexico. All of a sudden I was transported to some humungous house in the south of France with Abigail. There was a family there, but it wasn't my family and it wasn't Abigail's. Someone had some kind of disorder, and the family was making a video to send to a committee to get better hospital care for their kid. I was thrown into the middle of it, wearing some sort of costume, and having utterly no idea why I was there. Then Abigail and I were made to go shopping. We found a Wal-Mart (in the south of France). While we were shopping, Abigail started stealing other people's groceries that they had already paid for. The manager of the store caught us, but Abigail managed to get away. She caught me and started interrogating me. I began to cry until she said, ""I know it was your friend, not you, so I'll let you go if you find her and turn her in."" I didn't know what to do and only prayed that Abigail had run far enough away that I wouldn't find her and have to turn her in.

I didn't want to talk to him so I snapped my phone in two. Then I realized I wasn't wearing a bra and became really self-conscious. Finally, there was some dog who was trying to follow me around, and I realized it was someone named Doug, a person I have never actually met in real life, but whom I knew in my dream to be my soul mate, who had the ability to transform into a dog. It was so strange and I honestly felt like I was just walking through a world of other people's dreams!","1FSA, 2JSA, 1ISA, 1MOA, 1ANI, 1MKA","CO D, SD D"

8099,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,0309,1999-,2001-10-16,F,A,"I was in my apartment with Mother and some other members of my family that I cannot identify. It was not my waking life apartment. Something had happened that I realized this was a perfect opportunity to make some major furnishing changes in my apartment. I was going to switch the living room with the dining room for one thing. Currently in the dream home, the front door led directly into the dining room. Matthew had already hung curtains so I realized they were going to need to be switched as well. Matthew had arrived home from a visit with his Dad and the apartment was filled to capacity, little floor space left, with old furniture. I found out that Grandma and Grandpa Ho had intended to get rid of all this stuff and Matthew thought I might want some of it because of my interest in antiques and old furniture. So they sent it all with him, with the instructions for me to do whatever with the things I didn't want. There was a lot I didn't want and obviously didn't have room for all of it either. I still wanted to make the switch of the two rooms but now could not even find my original furnishings. At this point there were many other people there, most that I didn't know, and some were Harris family members. I believe BJ and Bev might have been there also. Everyone pitched in and began helping me to clear the place out by eliminating the items I didn't want. Now the apartment had a basement garage so we were taking these things through the stairwell into that space. Bob F was one of the men down there taking things from the people working upstairs. At some point I realized that a lot of the people who were helping were from a not-for-profit group and I was going to donate all of the things I didn't want to them. It almost felt as if things were multiplying because I kept finding more and more stuff that I hadn't realized was there before. There were several old sofas and big easy chairs. There were quite a few huge wood pieces, such as wall units, or bookshelf kind of things. Many of these were hideous looking in my opinion. They were very large, heavy and difficult to move. We were alternating our positions and jobs in clearing the place out. Some people wanted turns being at the top of the stairs. I mostly stood between the various rooms and the top of the stairs and kept pushing things toward the person at the top of the stairs. I would occasionally put things into the stair well myself. Sometimes just sitting things on the first landing and sometimes handing things down to men in the basement/garage. The stairwell had a few steps to the first landing, then turned left and went the rest of the way down. I had taken something with two legs that I thought was very light and not dangerous and just kind of pushed it down. I realized after I let go that one of the legs hit someone in the head. Instead of saying anything I walked away. As I did so I knew I should go back and acknowledge what I did and apologize but I was too embarrassed and for some reason afraid to. Then I heard people talking loudly and criticizing what had happened. The man was bleeding but I don't know how badly. Someone thought he might need stitches but most thought that person was overreacting. I never did go and admit what I had done. This was taking much longer than people had thought it would. Many of us were beginning to get hungry. I went and asked Daddy if I should order dinner to be delivered. I don't remember him answering me then but I didn't do it. At the time I thought I didn't need his permission to do that if I'm going to pay for it myself. Maybe I thought if I asked him he would offer to pay. In waking life I know he would. For whatever reason we didn't order dinner and we kept working. The Harris family members that were there had been there for another reason and had not expected to stay so long. Even when they decided to stay and help with this new situation they didn't realize it would take so long. I don't think any of us did. They were particularly hungry. I kept thinking about how Darren and Matthew got all of this stuff here and how I could have been unaware of them bringing all of this stuff into the apartment when it had to have taken them a good deal of time. BJ and Bev kept identifying items that they thought I would want to keep. One of them found a beautiful bedroom suit. It was white with a pastel flower design/fabric on parts of it. I said that I absolutely wanted to keep that. In waking life I have wanted a new bedroom suit for almost 20 years, but can never seem to afford it. They and we found quite a few really great furniture items, artwork, two really great desks. one that I would keep in the kitchen and one for my office, other decorative items. Some of the artwork seemed very contemporary and colorful. In fact, there was an artist there painting a piece similar to several that were already there. I felt bad that he saw me deciding to give them away. I kind of liked them but not enough to keep them in light of everything I had there. At some point the scene shifted and we were still in the same apartment but it now seemed as though we were clearing out the remnants of someone who used to live there for us to move in. There were things hanging on the walls that needed to be removed. Some things I would decide to keep and either not remove or rehang after thinking about it. In the kitchen there were cabinets full of white/see-through plastic containers and I gave away the containers and everything. There were also quite a few small wooden cabinets for lack of a better word, that had lots of little compartments and such. They were each made to house certain types of items. I had removed one from the wall, examined it carefully, and then replaced it deciding to keep it. I then decided to keep all of the similar ones. There were also two or more refrigerators. They had containers in them but no food. I gave away all but one of them, containers and all. The one I kept seemed to fit nicely into a kitchen cove. It was smaller than a conventional home refrigerator and it was brown. As we continued to clear things out I decided to put all of the artwork in one place together and I would not go through it until after I had the furniture I wanted and placed where I wanted it. Then I could better decide which artwork I wanted to keep and had the space to hang. There was a lot of artwork and I really liked most of it. We continued to try to find the living room and dining room pieces that I wanted to keep and get them placed where I wanted them. I wanted to gather the pieces into the appropriate room and then have Mother help me decided where to place things for the best aesthetic results. For some reason I was focusing on completing the dining room first, but was definitely focused on the living room second. we thought we were almost done and then realized that my bedroom was still full so we began working on it. Then we thought we were almost done and we realized the kitchen was still full. In working on emptying the kitchen I noticed all of the things hanging on the walls that needed to be removed. I removed some of them but asked others to help with that. I went into the bedroom and began selectively taking things off the walls. I kept the religious items that were there and some of the lighting fixtures/lamps. The only thing in particular that I remember hanging in the kitchen, though I remember there were a lot of things hanging, is a small yarn thing that reminded me of a miniature flower holder that was popular maybe twenty years ago. People were beginning to complain more and more about how hungry they were. I finally decided to go ahead and order pizza. One man pulled a bunch of pizza coupons out of his pocket. They offered two medium pizzas for $9.99. I asked someone to call in an order and just order a variety of different kinds. There were a lot of people there so they needed to figure out how many to order. There were a lot of wicker decorative items. Some of them were basket like in nature and I would put things from the walls in them. Some of the huge wood wall units still had many items sitting on the shelves. We were moving them with the things still in place. I have no idea how those things did not fall off. I was always glad when I could push a piece onto an area rug and move it along with no problem. Some of the things were oddly shaped and we had to figure out how to get them down the L-shaped stairwell. Some were extremely heavy. Some that I thought would be really heavy I would see one or two men hoist above their heads and carry them out. Some large items were so light I could lift them with one hand and push them down the stairs myself, even some of the large, stuffed chairs.","1FKA, 1MKA, 2JSA, 1MKA, 2JSA, 2JSA",

The carpet isn't actually straight, it turns out; at the spot where it crosses the metal strip on the floor that divides our office it jogs a little bit, and also a bit further on. You can't really see it until you put the yardstick down next to it, but it does mean that the new carpet will have to be specially made to correspond. About this time I realize how late it's getting, and I've got a yoga class to get to. I don't have a car at the moment, and I haven't got another way to get there since it's too late for (the bus?), so I'll have to take a cab. The class is in a place I haven't gone before, it's being held at a middle school almost all the way to my Mom's house. I'm sharing the cab with a guy I know, and he knows how to get there, so he tells the driver, but he doesn't go that way. The guy says that's okay, it's just another way to get there, but the driver seems to prefer this one. Heigh-ho. At the school, we pull into a sort of enclosed carport, and I get out. I don't know where to go, but there are a number of kids about, so I ask a boy who's with a group on the stairs. He doesn't know himself, but says he'll go in and ask a teacher. When he comes back, he takes me inside to a room that looks like it belongs in a school, rather old and institutional. It's next to a sort of kitchen. The boy introduces me to a teacher who says I can wait here while he goes to locate the class, but his look and manner suggest he thinks it's rather odd for me to be here. And he says he thought the class was just for kids. Well, he goes off to find out how I can get there, and I start wondering if maybe he's right - is this just a class for junior-high school kids? Ooh. I may be very out of place here. (The class, by the way, is one of the regular City Yoga Center classes - I think Fred's teaching. I just haven't ever come to this one before.) The teacher is gone a very long time, during which I doze off for a minute. After a while of poking around bored, I notice that it's flat dark outside. Good grief, how did that happen? I look out the window - I listen - I realize that there's nobody here. A lot more time has passed than I thought. The class is probably even over by now. I'm also concerned about how I'm going to get out of here. If I can find a phone I can call Mom, but that also means I'll have to find an unlocked door. I go towards the kitchen door and realize I'm hearing voices. Walking into the room, I find 2 or 3 women standing in a group, talking. One of them looks particularly startled when she sees me - and as I start to explain myself and ask how I can find a phone, etc., she lays into me like nobody's business, saying, ""Don't you pull that stuff on me, I know all about people like you, you'd better get your butt right out of here"" - or words to that effect. I apologize for being a nuisance and all and try to talk again, but she starts in again. She's quite pissed. One of the other women starts to speak to me - without the hostility - and the first one goes again. By this time I've had about enough abuse, and I say so. I raise my voice and very firmly tell her I'm not going to take any more crap from her, I want a telephone so I can call my mother to come get me out of this place*. She clams up. Another woman (who I think came up in the middle of this) takes over and says she'll help me out, so she escorts me away. She's very nice, this person - she's rather short, with medium brown hair, nice friendly face and manner if a bit reserved. Next thing, we're in a bathroom; I'm looking at myself in a mirror and we're having a conversation.","1MKA, 1FKA, 1MKA, 2JSA",

R. of Iowa city but did not look just like him, made me think of Wallin. The room was a long narrow one opening into a church auditorium. Rev. R. said something about collection. I remembered I had none but would look in my coat pocket. Went to coat room. In reaching over folding chairs knocked down some caps, blue and gray angoratams, and found some money, mostly Chinese coppers had fallen out. I picked them up and took them with me as I did not know which wrap they had fallen from. Return to class, sit at side table. Found a short man, dark man by Rev. R. and several pupils. They were drawing up a biographical sketch of Rev. R. Something about an election as to his continuance. He asked if his son could join the class. All said yes. I wondered why a boy in a woman's class. Boy looked pleased and embarrassed. Then we were eating at the same long table. Peculiarly served meal. I asked people near me how to find claimant of my find explaining why I kept the cash. Might I leave it with the dean of women. People around me are changing. Some are from Fargo College. Decide I will advertise in the Iowan.   People are leaving table. I look up and find Rev. R. and others talking but at our end we are through. Excuse self, go to coat room for wraps. Coat room is a suite of three rooms. Tell some girls ""I'll show you why I was late for class but I don't want others to see."" Three girls laughing spread themselves out as a screen and I show them the money. One girl is B. Wellman. A tiny Chinese girl sees and asks, ""Is it Chinese money?"" I ask ""Did you lose some?"" She says ""no"" but names someone who did. I look for paper to write down my name and address and phone and have him come for money. She says, ""He'll come."" And then he's there. A rather stout Chinese enters the inner coatroom and gives as his name the one the child gave. He leads me to outer room and we seat ourselves in rockers. There is a woman there who is Chinese but her face is half dark like a Negro's. I ask him how he lost money in a woman's coatroom. He says, ""But she was with me."" I ask him how much he lost. For a long time can get no answer. Then he says, ""40 coppers."" I start to count them out for him but there are not that many. Suddenly I realize something is wrong and that he had not really lost that money. Then we are on the street, I coming after him. He throws the money into a basement window grating. Then changes its place and drops its. He tries to extract it but goes on. I come up and try to find it. There are broken dolls in the dirt by the window but it is a business house and at last after I have dug about for a while, I realize it dropped into a room inside but it is noon and I can't get in. I enter waiting room of the building but keep on retreating to corner where I shan't be seen to fix bloomers. When skirt is up a woman is ushered in to wait. I apologize for my condition. Other people enter. A man asks if I will help him invoice that p.m. I say I'll be glad to have work but I've never invoiced before but I's sure I could do it. Then he looks at the woman's papers and tells her to go away until she's 14. I wonder how she can look so old. Then another one waiting tells me to take my turn but I say I've done but I must see the heads. Then father comes in wearing a beard. (He had it cut off some years before his death.) I think I must be seeing wrong for he's dead. It must be his brother, uncle M., but it is father and I ask him, ""How could you come back?"" He says ""Oh, I could"", and kisses me. I say, ""It feels just like you again."" He laughs, ""Of course."" We go downstairs to the basement. I see an almost empty room reminding me of the Sunday school room and tell father, ""The day nursery used to be there but we moved it upstairs."" We go through many rooms. In one room rich people are eating lunch. At last we reach the office near the window behind some junk.

I was facing cabinets on the wall opposite the stove. I had sanded two of them down. I was getting ready to refinish them. And Niecy Nash, from the TV program Clean House, came in. They were there doing the show at someone else's house. Maybe someone close by? It was like she had taken a break from the show and had come in to see what I was doing. She said something about me refinishing the cabinets. I showed her how much nicer, how much prettier the wood looked after I had sanded them down. I just sanded down the doors on two of the cabinets. I was thinking about replacing the hardware as well. The ones I had sanded still had some spots that needed to be sanded. And on the one, the wood looked much prettier. First I showed her the one closest to the doorway. She saw the difference but wasn't all that impressed. Then I showed her the other one and she realized what I was talking about then how you could really see the wood grain and how pretty it was. So then she kind of agreed that it was a good idea. But it wasn't until then, after I had sanded two of them down, that I started thinking about the fact that it is a rented building and would the landlord mind me doing this? I didn't think they would because I would just be improving the property. Making it look nicer. But yet, I didn't ask them beforehand.

9318,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,1528,1999-,2007-01-23,F,A,"I was in a very unusual two-story home. One end of the home is attached to the owner's retail store. The home was owned by a couple with two young adult children. The woman had asked me to talk to a decorator about some changes she wanted made to the home, including structural changes. I am talking to the decorator about creating a very nice master suite with a luxurious master bath. I specified a whirlpool tub and for the shower I specified a bench seat and making it a steam shower. I wondered about talking to him about a sauna but decided against it, thinking that what I had already specified would be sufficient. They also wanted to expand their garage. I walked him out to the garage, which was one-car only. It was completely empty. I told him that all four members of the family have their own car. The outer wall of the garage is the wall that was attached to the retail store so I didn't know how he would be able to expand it to house more than one car. The owners had not specified if they wanted it to house just one additional car or all four cars. The son had several friends spending the night. His bedroom is on the first floor. The daughter's bedroom in on the second floor but it is only accessible via a ladder and by going up this ladder you can only access her bedroom. The room ran the full width of the house though it was no wider than an average bedroom. There was a bed on each end. She had one friend spending the night and I was spending the night. The parents had decided I would sleep in the daughter's room. I could tell she was not too pleased about this. To try to make it easier I told her I would just sleep on the floor in the middle of the room. The son and his friends are in there watching TV but are also planning to sleep in there. The son has never kissed a girl before and he wants me to teach him how. I keep telling him that I can't do that but he tries once anyway. There is a square opening in the wall that is barely big enough for a person to fit through. It is an opening for a rectangular area with a diameter no bigger than the square opening. I crawl in there and lie down on my back intending to sleep in there away from the others. The son crawls in and I tell him he needs to get out. He tries again to kiss me. Then one of his friends crawls in. They finally both get out. The daughter's friend tells the parents that I am making out with the boys. I defend myself and tell them that it is not true, though I don't tell them what their son did. They don't believe me. The daughter has left the house because she was very upset about something unrelated. As soon as the parents hear that she is gone they panic and decide they are going out to try to find her. The son and I are going along. We are rushing around to find shoes and coats so we can leave. The son goes out on his own and comes back to tell his parents that he found her and she is dead. He found her floating on her back in the water behind the house. We all go out. It is dark out so we can barely see where we are walking. It is a steep hill so we lean back to try to keep our balance as we make our way down the steep embankment. We get to the bottom and the son shines a flashlight on his sisters' body. It hardly looks like her. She looks like she has been out there for a long time instead of a just a few hours. I only look for a few seconds because it is so disturbing. The inside of the house, the walls, the floors, the ceiling, is constructed with unfinished wood. The stairways are very unusual or are ladders. There is a pole that the boys use to go downstairs, sliding down as though it were a fireman's pole. There is a man there that I need to leave as soon as possible so they don't try to involve me in any of the drama. I follow him to get out and away. I'm now on a boat with this man, Frank B from Trading Spaces. There is still a problem. He realizes that we just need to get off of this boat. We create another kind of boat out of unfinished wood and poles. There are quite a few of us that get on and go off on our own. It has two levels but there are several sections on each level. As we're floating along the water, at times there is low hanging foliage that brushes the top of the boat, almost coming inside at times. We see things that we can eat. Since we have no food on the boat we start pulling these off the branches as we continue to move. We can't stop the boat. We don't know what some of the things are but we take them anyway. We also see bananas. As soon as we see those we begin grabbing those quickly so we can get as many as possible even though we know we shouldn't eat more than one day for good colon health. Someone in another section had seen and grabbed a bunch of strawberries. We're taking turns steering the boat. Someone tells me that it's time for me to take a break and get some rest. I climb up on a platform that is just big enough to lie down on. It is held in place by a wooden pole on each corner that is fairly small in diameter, maybe only 3 or 4 inches. But the platform seemed very sturdy. There was something laying on the platform and I just lay on top of it. As I was laying there I kept reaching for this stuff to make sure it didn't fall off. Frank was either sitting or laying on a platform underneath me. Someone said something to me that caused me to be concerned about his well-being. We were on this thing for quite some time. Frank and I became quite close and ended up getting married. We are in danger from someone that wasn't on either boat. We had to be very careful to keep everyone on the boat safe from the people on shore. Some of the people on the boat also became a threat. We had to be especially careful not to go in the sections of the boat where these people are. One person in the dangerous group knew me and Frank and didn't want to see us get hurt so he helped us to stay together and safe. Some of us had gotten off the boat and were in the water. I had several six-inch square pieces of paper with notes on them from Jennifer F. They were notes for her boyfriend. I was worried that they were going to get wet. I managed to get them in a plastic container that was almost exactly the same size as the papers. He was one of the people on the shore that we were in danger of. Yet, because he knew me, he was not doing anything to harm any of us. He essentially pretended not to see us.","1FSA, 1MOA, 2JSA, 1FKA, 2JSA, 1FSA",AN 1FKA

We were working on a project to reduce violence or develop methods other than weapons to defeat the enemy. We were having different meetings. At times I was frustrated because, as usual, people weren't hearing me or weren't truly considering what I was saying. We had found some toy green plastic army men. We had decided to make something like a biscuit and place the toys inside the biscuit. The others wanted to put them in before baking the biscuit. I told them they would melt that way and that we would have to put it in later. They all disagreed with me and they were going to go ahead and do it their way. Really strange. I don't know how that ended up but I think I saved one out to maybe do myself, my way. I moved on to the kitchen area where the men on KP duty were preparing meals. I learned that a lot of our men got sick from that food. One of the reasons was that they got salmonella poisoning from hamburgers that had been cooked but then had been left sit out too long. The cooks would not know how many to prepare at a time and they didn't want to run out so they would prepare more than they thought they needed. They didn't want to throw any away so they would leave them sit out until the next group of men came in to eat. I had suggested that they have a counter at the doorway. a bar like you see at an entertainment venue. so it would count the number of men coming in. The men in the kitchen would be able to see/watch it and could use that as a gauge to determine how many to prepare. The head cook thought that was a great idea and said he would take it to the proper decision-maker. I pursued that a little bit and told him I was going to follow up with him and see how that conversation went and so forth. I met someone and I introduced myself as the future VP of the US. He kind of chuckled. I chuckled too but said, you just watch. A little bit later I met Hillary Clinton. She was the President of the US. I again introduced myself as the future VP of the US. We chatted a bit and I said, I'll be following up on that counter idea. She looked at me quizzically as she didn't know what I was talking about. Someone else was in our conversation and said, we'll talk about that later. I went back to the kitchen and I was still looking at things there. It occurred to me, I suggested to someone, if we would be able to poison the enemy's food as an alternative to weaponry. They said yes that would probably be doable. might be fairly easy. There was a discussion about what kind of foods we would use and such. I overheard one of the men talking about getting a divorce when he gets home. I was talking to them about that and discouraging the idea. He said something to me that hurt my feelings. I said so and was being a little dramatic about it but not letting on that I was. He apologized and I said, we'll make that. I had been standing on the other side of the counter so I went around the corner and gave him a hug but he didn't let go. He was kind of joking around and kind of doing that for the benefit of his buddies there because they were getting a real chuckle watching us. Then he kissed me. A long time. Then he asked me how I learned to kiss like that. Then he whispered in my ear, you want to give them a real show now? We'll give them a little tongue. I said, You want to give them a real show? Just follow my lead. Because I didn't think the first kiss was that good.","2MKA, 2MOA, 1MOA, 2MOA, 1FPA, 1FPA",CO D

My client Theresa crawls over everyone and me to come up front to help. My father's looking for a place to slow down. She reaches around to my right on the outside of the car where the gas tank cap is and I say, ""No, not there, on the door."" She then reaches a gas tank-like cap she has out to fit it into the recessed hole that exactly matches the configuration of the cap and carefully moves it until it clinks in and then she pulls the door shut. Now we've arrived at the town. It's our new town that I've been so happy about and as we drive I realize I've made a mistake. I'm a teenager and all the stores have toys and amusements for children, which will be great for the kids, but I'll soon be bored and then there will be nothing for me. I see western town store fronts too. I start lamenting, ""Oh, no. There's no one here for me. This is awful."" Now we're walking across a huge field toward our house and I'm saying over and over, ""I've made a terrible mistake. There will not be anyone for me here."" My mother (young and helpful) shows me the two agate/stone teardrop shaped necklaces I've given her for good luck and says, ""See, I've still got these on."" A huge community marching band is preparing to practice for a parade. There are hundreds of people, many teenagers. We accidentally walk through them. As I'm looking around, I am still lamenting, ""No one for me, a bad mistake."" We are then surrounded by the marching/milling crowd. I see a woman in a wheelchair with huge back wheels, decorated. I'm annoyed with her. She nearly pushed me aside. I see young men pretending to be Indians on horseback. One has a flaming arrow, but the flame goes out too soon. My father points out a circle on a sign, like an Indian hoop, but it's an auto tire with tools glued to it to advertise a local car repair shop. We get through the people and now I see our new house. We go in. It's isolated and in the country. It's miles from town. The first room is a kitchen, and kind of messy. We're (my mother and I) looking out a window. I see nothing but grass (no crops). I then notice out the back window the shadowy shape of a big brown owl-like bird. ""Oh,"" I say, ""an owl."" He flies around to the window we're at and lands right on the sill and we look at each other. He has ordinary bird eyes. Then he flies away. I go to the back window and look out. I see a creek. I say, ""Look! We have our own creek."" I'm thinking it might be fun to swim and wade in the summer, but then I notice mosquitoes all over the surface and tadpoles in the water. It didn't look so inviting. The bank on the other side goes up steeply, and there is not much space to run and play. There are hardly any trees. Now my mother and I go to the next room. ""What's this?"" I ask. ""One of those 'dining room things.'"" I'm not impressed. We go into the next room. It's huge and spacious. ""It's another kitchen,"" I say amazed, ""and look at the beautiful fireplace."" It's a brick country style fireplace. We go from room to room, amazed at how many there are and how nice and spacious and pretty they are. We are called to look at the ""play"" room. We go in. Some of the kids have the couch made out to a hideaway bed. I see a piano but it has some keys missing. Then my father says, ""Look at this!"" with excitement. I look. It's a player piano. I'm so happy, just like at Grandma Agnes'. He points to the music roll and I see very ornate notation. The classics! Very unusual and complicated for a player piano. Then, I see there are two player pianos. I see another hideaway bed. It's not in very good shape. My father says, ""The kids have already decided this one's for guests we don't like."" I laugh. I see a back staircase and a tiny bathroom. It only has a toilet. I then notice the stairs are all flat and down, but if you push a button they pop up into usable stairs. I think, ""That would be dangerous if someone at the top was coming down and someone didn't know it and pushed the button. They'd have quite a fall.""","1ANI, 1MKA, 1MKA, 2JSC, 1FKA, 1FKA","HA D, SD D"

8131,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,0341,1999-,2001-12-08,F,A,"Someone had broken into my house. I was wondering if I was dreaming or awake. I thought that I usually only have these dreams when I don't set my house alarm before going to bed and I know I set it last night. But then if I'm dreaming I want to wake myself up and I couldn't. So I was frustrated with myself. I also thought if I'm dreaming and lucid why can't I change what is happening. I could see my front door from my bedroom door, which I can't in waking life. This did not occur to me. I was trying to close and lock my bedroom door very quietly. I was peering out and could see that my front door was partially open. I didn't know if someone had come in and left or if someone was still in the house. I didn't know if it was just maintenance men or someone who had broken in. I went ahead and locked it and hoped that they either wouldn't come upstairs and try to get in or that if they saw that door that maybe they would just leave but they didn't. my bedroom door was right across from the end of my bed. I heard them come up and try the door so I leveraged myself against the door with my feet against the bed hoping to keep them from getting in. I heard them take out the tools and remove the pins in the door. They shouldn't be able to do this from the outside in waking life because the pins are on the inside of the room. But they did remove them. I was being unsuccessful in keeping them out. I tried to reach the alarm pull cord but couldn't get to it. They finally got in and they said something about me not being able to get to it. They didn't hurt me. I started talking to them and trying to be very cooperative so they wouldn't get violent or hurt me. There were both men and women. They said that they had recently bought or built a new home and they were here to get things that they needed or could use in their new house. I said I was surprised that they wanted anything that I have. I went downstairs with them and they had a very large pile of my things that they were going to take with them. One of things that they had was my black everyday dishes. I asked them to let me keep those and I would give them my expensive china that I never use. I told them that it was Noritake, very elegant, and there were many more place settings, etc. so they agreed to that. I was going through these wood cabinets, kind of like an armoire, though they were built into the wall. They had many different size compartments. Some were drawers. Some had doors. Some were just open. I thought this must be a dream because I don't have these cabinets in waking life. I was looking for the china and couldn't find it. I told them the one box was an old whiskey box that would be used to ship 12 bottles. I was getting very nervous because I was afraid they would think that I was lying and didn't really have the china. I suggested that they might have found it already and not realized it. I turned around and saw it sitting in their pile and pointed it out. I told them the other box was the original box and said china on the sides of it. We found it too then.","2MSA, 2MOA","CO D, AN D"

I was really excited to do this through most of the dream. Regan K was actually Ben D. I went to the UM and taught class. I was very anxious about it going well, about doing well. At the end of the class I was asking someone to tell me when the class was over. Someone from the school had come in, maybe to make some announcements. I told them they had ten more minutes to study and then I would give them a 30-minute test. Then we would have 5 minutes of announcements. When they finished their tests I told them they could leave it on their desks and I would come around and pick them up after everyone left. Some people left their test lying under their coat, or in their coat, or on their coat, or had it sitting with their coat. They had all left and left their coats. I went around and picked up the tests. I was packing up and Ben D came in. I told him that I was a little anxious about how it went, especially being that it was his class. I care what he thinks. He walked me out and held out his arms to give me a hug, and then we kissed each other on the cheek. I walked away and started to my car. I thought, oh, that wasn't Ben D at all. That was Regan K. I was thinking about the fact that he had reached out his arms to hug me and that we kissed each other on the cheek. I thought that was nice. I was disappointed that he morphed into Regan K. I was on my way back to the office I think. This one road was very narrow. It was covered with snow and there was a high bank on either side. The weather was very bad. It was snow and ice. Cars were coming and I could see that there was only room for one car. I pulled over as much as possible and stop to allow the other cars to pass. I saw this other car coming up behind me. I wondered if they would slow down and pull over as well. I was concerned that they would hit me because they seemed to be driving too fast for the road conditions and they didn't seem to be slowing down. At first they stopped and then they started around me, into this other section of the road. Then they saw why I had pulled over so they backed up and pulled off. Twice they did this. Finally they let me go first. I got to a place where there was something like an avalanche. The snow had fallen down in and had just completely blocked the road. Now I wasn't in a car. The snow had completely enveloped me from the waist down. This other car was buried and I was very concerned about them. Part of me said something to insinuate that this is what they get for their bad driving. I was pushing on the one bank in front of me to use it as leverage to pull myself out. Then I got far enough that I could grab a small tree branch. As I was doing this I realized that the woman in the car behind was able to get out of the car part of the way so she was only waist high in the snow. She had her cell phone and was calling for help. In the meantime I was pulling myself out and headed to the office. I went back and Bruce U, the maintenance man, was working. At one place some other maintenance men were working. I had to get down and kind of get down on my stomach and shimmy through this hole in the wall to get into this one part of the building. Then I came to another place that was the same way. Bruce U was working. I didn't want to have to do that again. I asked Bruce U if I could just get in that way. He said yes and moved something so I could just walk in. I think some of my family was there. Daddy was there and Uncle H. I think Larry K and some others. We had talked about something but I don't remember what. I walked away and then I came back. I asked someone how far the UM is from here. Even though I had just driven it I didn't know how far it was. I thought that maybe it was just an hour. Uncle H and someone else seemed to agree that it was four hours. I said, Well, I thought maybe Mother and Daddy could go to this graduation. They couldn't go to the first two. I thought that maybe they could go to one out of three. But I guess not. Then I thought, It just isn't that important anyway. Because I was going to be there teaching for four hours, Ben D enrolled me in some kind of teachers association. After I finished teaching he told me this and I found out also that I was going to get paid. I was very excited about both of these things. He said something about the fact that all teachers belong to this association.","1MKA, 1ISA, 2JSA, 2JSA","AP D, SD D, AP D"

When I went up to receive the Blood of Christ, the Eucharistic Minister was trying to use a new phrase and she couldn't remember it. She was mumbling and kind of being flippant. Finally she just said, oh well, The Blood of Christ and then just continued using that phrase. I was standing in back when church let out and I was trying to push my way through the crowds to get to someone (or something) quickly. before I missed them or it. Matthew and I are in the car. He is driving. We were behind some buildings and he was going to park right behind a bunch of emergency vehicles. fire engines and ambulances. I told him he couldn't park there but that he could park anywhere else along the building. We never did park. The next thing I saw were people going through kind of a drive-thru window for something but it wasn't a restaurant. I told Matthew to drive around them and leave. As we were getting ready to leave we saw a young black man giving someone in another car something that looked like aspirin from this giant bottle. He approached our car. I was curious so I told Matthew to stop. He gave us two and it turned out they were batteries that looked like aspirin. He gave us a bottle of them. the size of a regular aspirin bottle. As we left I was telling Matthew what an ingenious marketing idea that was. Now I'm driving, and really fast because Matthew was going to be late for work and he had to get home to change before going to work. I sped through a yellow light. I accidentally drove through a red light. As soon as I realized what I did and ran three more in a row. I couldn't seem to help it. I was finally able to stop the car, a screeching stop, for the last one. At that time I realized there was a police car ahead of me, but he didn't do anything. We're at the church office. There were three desks sitting in the lobby. I thought it was odd the way they were set up because two of them, the two in front, had their backs to the door and where people would come in. Matthew and I had gone into the back of the church and brought some things into the office. Matthew was sitting at one of the desks typing something that he needed to leave there. It was due or overdue. Just as he thought it was done he realized he had typed it in all caps so he had to retype it. While he was doing that Julie O came out and I commented about the desks- that she had gotten that beautiful new desk unit and now they took it away and put these desks there. I didn't tell her what I thought of the two that had their backs to the door. She made some comment to say that this was a good thing. Of course she would, whether she really thought so or not. That would be the nice Christian thing to do. I was giving two other women that came out the other things that I had carried into the office from the back of church. The paper bag had things in it that people had been making in the back of church. They reminded me of valentine things but were very large, made out of large colored paper. I said I didn't know what they were but that they kind of looked like Valentine things. They were puzzled by that but then mentioned something about Alice S and I said, yes, she would be working on that about now. So they took the bag. After they took it I found some others lying on the floor. I picked them up and placed them on one of the desks. One of the things is my little cedar chest that normally sits on my dresser. It was full of pictures. The pictures on the bottom were of Matthew and I. At first I told them I wasn't sure what it was and when I saw the pictures of Matthew and I on the bottom I said, Oh, now I know. Someone saw my chest sitting here with these pictures so they just put their own on top. They agreed that made sense. We saw a few of the pictures that had been added. The people were naked, some had body paint, but you couldn't see any genitals or any of the women's breasts. They took the chest and I told them that, of course, I would want the chest back. They said of course, but they didn't bring it back. As Matthew was finishing his typing I asked if I could take the chest back with me now and someone went to get it.","1FOA, 2JSA, 1MSA, 1MSA, 1MOA",CO D

We started to make out.  She touched her own genitals like an invitation or to show me, and then I took over.  I stroked her clitoris, and she put her head back and groaned with pleasure, smiling.  I was so glad that she liked it.  I asked her questions about how to do it just like she liked, ""on the underside?""  I recalled my wish (in waking life) for her to feel orgasm, since she never has.  Her clitoris was the type in a previous dream about my oldest sister, more like a penis than female.

Also I said something about how I couldn't even picture actual intercourse with a woman, I wanted a man to fuck me, and a woman wasn't going to satisfy the things I needed to feel in sex.  I was imagining her body pressed next to mine in intercourse, how it wasn't going to do to me what a man could.  There was also some feeling of ruining our friendship if we went further.  She just stared at me, with a look like massive disappointment or disbelief, almost like I was betraying her.  She just kept looking straight at me, not saying anything.  There were other things we had to do.  We had been interrupted from these things.  When we started making out it was like we were playing hooky from some job we had to do there, sneaking off and hoping no one saw we were not working.  But we were obviously attracted to each other, so we almost couldn't help ourselves, making out like that.  But now it seemed our other duties there were surfacing, interrupting us from going further.  It seemed like it was winter, cold out, that's why we had come inside.","1FKA, 1FKA","HA D, AP D, SD 1FKA"

I walk to my car when all the sudden I see Ben , Larry, Jeremy and George, and they need a ride, so I'm like, ""Sure, guys, let's go."" All of the sudden I'm riding my bike on the West Side of the city, right by Bill's Wheels, and I'm no longer with Ben and his crew, but I'm with Paul and the Mt. Diablo crew. Paul says, ""Let's go to the Boardwalk and get some weed!"" I'm down, so we head to the Boardwalk. Even though we're traveling towards the Mall, we're all the sudden at the Boardwalk and I'm no longer with Paul and the guys. I'm with Melinda and she's looking really hot. I'm with her outside of the Beach Bowl and there is some weird confusion. There's talk of alcohol and weed and getting caught, and all of the sudden there is no more confusion and she has a fat baggy full of weed in her hand. There are police everywhere. One stops us and asks us questions, then leaves. We're walking down the sidewalk toward the beach when Melinda hands some of the bag's contents to someone walking in our opposite direction, and at the same time drops the baggy in front of a cop. I reach down to grab the baggy and for the first time I see the weed, and it doesn't look like weed. It sort of looks like salad or flowers or something, but I grab it anyways and run. Now we're walking on the wharf and Melinda says, ""Let's smoke and then go dancing all night."" For some reason I feel like if I don't make my move right now, I won't ever get to see her again. I take her hand and go to the beach. There is no sand on the beach for some reason, just knee-high water. As we walk farther out I start to say romantic stuff I can't remember. There is a big pile of rocks there. We finally got to kiss here, and she says, ""Wait, let me put down my purse."" It takes what seems like eternity for her to put it down on the rocks, and while she does, I can feel myself beginning to wake up. In desperation, I grab the purse and throw it on the rocks. She stops and looks at me. Then she grabs me, pulls me to her and we start making out. Then I wake up.","1MKA, 2MKA, 1MKA, 2MOA, 1ISA, 1MOA",
293,alta,Alta: a detailed dreamer,291,1985-1997,1990-06-29,F,A,"I'm at a camp somewhere - it's not just a resort, I seem to be learning something, doing practical things. All I know about it is the outside is nice; I'm kind of liking it here, but I've had about enough of it now. There are a lot of people here, some of them I know, some I don't. If it's not Sunday morning right now, then it's Sunday afternoon, and this guy who is like a counsellor - at least he's not just a participant either (we seem to have some official capacity, let's put it like that - we're not running the place, but we're not altogether guests, either) - and he has come back from somewhere. I expected a friend of ours to be with him; a young man who's kind of like Javier, in a way - he has that place, he's about the same age - sort of the new guy who's really good and everybody likes him and he's always around. And he's not with him and I'm wondering where he's gotten to. He's been off somewhere like to the store or something, on an errand into town, maybe. So I ask about him, and he says that he got called away, there was something he needed to go back for, and mentioning that it's about time I went back, too. He has a Sunday paper or there are some Sunday papers just now brought in - one of them is the Herald, of course, it's nice and clean and new and fresh, like Sunday papers start out - and of course I want to see the Lottery number, so I get hold of the paper and start looking in the front section. There's the comics the way they usually are, but usually for the weekday pages, inside the section, and they're also black and white (which the Herald's aren't at the moment) - anyhow, I don't get to the number before something else happens. This paper has a sort of a bug stuck to it - it falls out, and it's not just a bug; it's a ball of bugs. It's as though a bunch of these beetle-y sort of things have clubbed up together - maybe they've done this to hibernate, or something (I don't know why they would do such a thing, but they have), and they look dead; they look all motionless and dry. But just the same, even dead, I don't want to mess with bugs, so I figure I had better get rid of it. And it's a real challenge to scoop it up - the thing is maybe almost baseball-sized, real big bugs; they're orange, and shiny, and they literally are sort of side-by-side grouped together, making, mostly, a ball. There's a lot more than 5 or 6 of them, I should think. Now, I've decided I've got to take this thing away, of course, and so I scoop it up on the paper. The thing is, I don't do it quite there - for some reason, I have now decided to carry it to my mother's - so the next thing I'm aware of is being at her house. She isn't there; I'm curious about that and wondering when she's going to get back. [This is not my mother's house as it is in the real world] - this is more nearly like my grandparents' house - it's middleaged-old and has this ""rustic"" garage to it, that has your basic up-and-down door - it's cobwebby and musty in there, and somewhere along the line I've become aware of another ball of insects. This must have been at the house - I don't know where it came from. I've been into the garage, thinking I was gonna go into the house through it, and realizing they weren't there, went back outside to see what I could see there, and gone up on this sort of little porch, maybe to a side door of the house - it's right next to a large bush/tree - there's lots and lots of plants all around the house, in this nice summery sunshine, hot and all that - and this is where the other bug-thing comes into play. It's definitely alive - although I might have suspected that it was dying. I decide I had better get rid of it altogether, so I'm going to get a shovel and pound 'em apart. I go into the garage again, and first I see a short spade and pick that up - realize it's kind of small, look around again a little bit, find a real shovel, a long one with a good-sized blade on it, go back outside, and I find these things, and when I start pounding on 'em, it seems that I've got the short spade in my hand after all. Well, that's silly. So I put it down, pick up the shovel - which I have in fact got with me - now one of these things, that was up on the porch, seems to have been coming to life, sort of. That is why I got disturbed and dropped it. It was like it was giving birth to another bunch of bugs, which may have been in fact the case; on the bottom of the ball something looked like it was trying to break out of it, and I decide, ""We got enough bugs!"" (Don't ask me how I know that these were undesirable bugs, but that was my conclusion.) I am back here, starting to find the thing and pound the snot out of it, which I do. I'm sitting next to Nancy Gaines with a young girl who is sitting in front of us - we're with another bunch of people - she doesn't know us - we're visiting (and we may be sharing the LT, I'm not sure - but it's something we're there for that's new and unknown to these other people) and we haven't been entirely accepted yet. She's so far been nice to us, that's good - she's blond, looks like a nice kid. Nancy is (doing something like tying her shoelace) and talking about Kathy Carson - her name comes up in some way, and the girl says something like, ""Who's Kathy?"" We say one or two things about her, and I say, ""...and Nancy's gonna marry her!"" And Nancy says, ""Yeah! (something something) we're going to get married."" The girl is looking at us askance - she doesn't say anything, and I realize that this may not have been the most opportune moment to say that. But we did say it, and I go on to say something about what the girl has been talking to me about earlier. She has perhaps written a letter or something, - maybe it was poetry - maybe she was telling me something - all I know is, I know something from her that the others don't know, and I'm talking about her and how this is so interesting, and I quote from her a bit. The 2nd thing that I say from her that's a quote, I suddenly realize, ""Oh, hell, this is a direct quote of something that's privileged information, that's real personal, and I have not asked her permission to talk about this."" I am breaking confidentiality, and I am thoroughly ashamed of myself. I feel myself getting hot, and I'm sure I'm turning red, and I just feel mortified; looking at her, I'm saying, ""I am really, really sorry - I did not mean to do that."" Of course, she not realizing that I have a code of confidentiality at all, looks to me like she doesn't really understand what I'm so disturbed about, and that it really was okay with her. And she doesn't know that it might not have been okay with her - it hadn't occurred to her. I am really, really sorry about it.","2JSA, 1MKA, 1MKA",

We were taking a different class on a different day too. We were meeting at a fancy restaurant. 2 women had sat down at a table--it was a booth (banquette"" in fancy places they call it.) The waiter was slicing their fancy fish appetizers for them when they could have cut them by themselves. I needed to get around them and I stepped on one seat, then on the table and over to the other seat to get across. One lady left the table. She was offended. I had to go see my teacher up the stairs. He had fallen asleep on the floor. I laid down next to him and fell to sleep for a little while too. He couldn't remember when the next class was. Before I woke up a girl I didn't know had sat down at the table patiently, waiting for me. She was knowing. She waited patiently. She had cooked some pasta for us for dinner. When I got back it had gotten cold. We poured it from the pan. It was half cooked. I tried to eat a bite but it wouldn't even twirl on the fork. It was stiff and stuck together--gummy on the outside, hard on the inside. The girl said it was just right for her but I said, ""I'm gonna have to cook this some more. I hope you don't mind.""

He tells me the suitcase belongs to him. I have a funny feeling that the people to whom I'm showing the pictures may not return them to me. I see a car parked across the road and Mary is sitting inside it. I can see her clearly. She is beautiful. She is dressed in white. I know that she is dead, and that the road between us is the dividing line between Life and Death. I am on the Life side, Mary is on the Death side. She smiles briefly at me, but mostly the expression on her face is serious. We have a conversation, but I cannot see Mary's lips moving. I emphasize that the children are well, particularly Maria. Mary asks me why we hadn't had too much sex during the last couple of years of her life, especially the time before she took ill.

She had another child that was a little bit older - maybe 5 or 6 years old, a girl. The room was pretty messy. There was a screen door. The door was open so I walked up to the screen door and I asked if I could step inside for a second. She said okay. I could tell she was a little hesitant because she didn't know me or why I was there. I stepped inside and said, My name is Anna. I used to live here. You don't know me obviously. I wondered if I could just walk through the house. She said it wasn't a very good time that they really hadn't even closed on the house yet. I said that was fine, that I understood. I put my hand on my chest and was fighting back tears. I said that it was okay and that maybe I could come back another time. I left. As I got to the front sidewalk another woman came out.

I introduced myself and told her the same thing - that I used to live there and that I really just wanted to walk through the house. Her husband came out. We were all looking down the street and talking. They said that they had had trouble selling it and ended up selling it for less than they had hoped. I said I had the same problem. I was divorced. Actually, what I said is that we were going through a divorce so I just had to sell it. I told them the neighbors had gotten upset with me because I sold it as low as I did, but that I really didn't have much choice because I had to sell it and move. We had a nice talk. They both gave me their business cards and in fact the woman gave me two of them. She had two different business cards. They told me to give them a call in a few days and they would see if they could arrange for me to come over and walk through the house. There was a third person there but I don't know who she was or what her connection was to all of this. Now I'm standing at this outdoor sink. There's an attachment on the sink, kind of like the ones you would pull out to spray and rinse out the sink. I was doing something with that. It wasn't exactly like that though.

27191,van,Van: a video gamer,060,2007-,2008-12-27,M,A,"I dreamt that my high school sweetheart Cindy came to visit me while I was staying at grandma's house. Only the room was a mix between the most cluttered of my college apartments and the sparingly decorated extra bedroom upstairs in the house my grandparents have lived for the past quarter-decade. Four monitors were there. Two double displays, a long, modern single display and a smaller computer monitor set aside for my xbox. I wondered at both the waste and the potential utility. But I was please to have such an array -- just think of the organization! She came in as a small bird, burrowing through the ground. When she emerged, she was a woman changed. Or trying to change. The magnetism was there like always, only now, there was little facade of reticence. We seized upon each other, and we fell on the bed, the thick blankets all around. We took off our clothes. It wasn't a ravenous mutual stripping, but more a slow, casual progress toward the inevitable. I could see tattoos on her body. I doubted many were real, but even if they were stick-ons, their placement on her nubile body, the intricate swirls and flowers and dragons, attracted me to her in a new way. There was a mirrored design in that flat space between each of her breasts and shoulders. Her abdomen was covered with more, in attractive, symmetrical columns. I told her I liked this. It was the way she was showing her change. I trusted her, and she trusted me. She lay down, and I lay on top of her, finding my way in. Just like I remembered. Not long after we had started, I felt a paranoia. What can happen, will happen. We should cover up, just in case someone comes in. I reached back and pulled the old white comforter over us. With renewed vigor, I re-attached myself to her. Then a moment later, the door swung open, with a column of relatives at the door. My grandmother and grandfather were there, even though grandpa is long dead. Before I could say a word, Cindy blurted: ""Hello Mr. Grandpa!"" I said something nonsensical, meant to be a rock onto which the sponges of their desire to make an excuse for themselves to grow.  The door did not slam shut again as you would expect. Instead, everyone came in. I rolled over and brought the blankets back atop us. I jumped off the bed and put on pants. She covered up. They filed in. Sean (my 22 year old cousin), his friend, with a strange name, and perhaps others. We talked about miscellanea, and then, they urged us to go to church. I went along with the idea. Soon we were at a place with an exterior reminiscent of the library and art museum complex in the town where I went to high school. Inside was an auditorium, with a quiet, plexi-glass-covered press room and a tall crescent of seats, some of them doubles. Behind me, sat the church regulars. I walked in with my arm around Cindy, but she disappeared as I sat down. She was supposed to be right behind me. No matter. On a raised, square platform framed by a banister of dark-stained, glossy wood, an old woman with triangle-shaped, purple-dyed white hair spoke into a microphone, imploring questions about the scripture from the somewhat thin crowd. But this church was also synonymous with a performing arts center. It was as if the high school auditorium was transferred into a college auditorium near where I went to college, splashed with religious overtones. Grandma was occupied downstairs. She had somehow wanted to know what it was like to retrieve something from an oven herself. She'd shrunk down to an old, bird-like shape, like an owl with my grandma's face, her thinning hair turned into sparse and spotty down feathers. She was trying to carry a platter out from the oven (where the refrigerator is in her current kitchen setup) on her head, raised up with skinny, wing-like arms. How was she withstanding the heat? I said she needed to duck down a bit to make it out. Instead, she shrunk, turning into a tiny bird with an egg on her head, with curved, pin-like feathers sticking from the top, with pollen-like heads at the tips, like the stems inside a hibiscus flower. I washed her in the sink , careful not to knock off the intricate and endearing head display. But it fell into the garbage disposal. She was the size of a finch. In the middle of the question and answer sermon, a screen came down. Cindy had gone to do another performance. A voice from behind me, a peer-aged girl of hers, a sometimes friend, said ""not this one again. It's overrated."" But when the images flashed on the horizontal rectangular screen, with hues of indigo and white, edges rough like a blueprint, I saw that her dance was more a model strut than anything else. Her henna-tattooed body writhed around a pole that extended up and down to infinity. She floated throw the air, trails of black star fire and sparkle behind her. Her chest was bare. Her oval breasts tinted gray in the filter. And in her final pose, an angle that surveyed her body from high above, the bones in her pelvis stretched the band of her thong just far enough to see the bump of her clitoris emerge from the horizon of her flat and toned abdomen. I said to myself, ""I hope all these people know I'm doing that."" The show ended, and another woman with purple hair had taken to the platform, this time, shifted o the other side of the stage area. The original was now in the crowd. I raised my hand to ask a question, but put it down as the church women behind me chuckled to themselves that I should wait to see how things worked. I put my hand down, and some fat young man asked a stupid question. I wanted to ask about shellfish. The women asked what church I go to. I said non-denominational. I paused for a moment, and added, lying, Unitarianism . I waited to see their balk. Then the first purple-haired woman walked up the side-aisle, and an announced her name, followed by ""denominational"".","1FKA, 1FKA, 2JKA","CO D, AP D"

I was thinking about going somewhere so I had gone out to clean off the car and see how bad it was to decide if I really wanted to drive in that weather. As I got close to my car, it was parked to the left of the sidewalk, one of my neighbors across the street and to the right yelled out to me. I didn't understand her so I started walking towards her saying sorry I didn't understand you. She said it again but I still don't know what she said. As I got close to her I asked her if she was going out in this weather. She said she was going, to a family member or something to see the____. I'm going to say eclipse but it wasn't eclipse because it was night. I looked up into the sky and said I don't know enough about astronomy to know where to look. She said something like you can't see it from everywhere that's why she was going to this other person's house. It was something like you would be able to look into the sky and be able to see something like I'm trying to figure out how to describe it. I can picture it in my mind because when I was looking in the sky for it I knew what I was looking for. I knew what it would look like. It would look like a partial eclipse with a partial arc of light in the night sky. It wouldn't be moving like an eclipse either because it would be in one place for most of the night.","1FKA, 1ISA, 1ISA",

He is happy to get it and wants to do some figuring. I now go back through the room to find a better place to sit. I hear a young man playing drum sticks and beating out a beat and doing some rhyming chant that makes fun of me as a sexy lady. He throws the drum sticks and a bunch land in my hair. I stalk over to him and pull out two drum sticks and beat a fancy beat on the chair he sits in. Everyone is impressed with how well I do that. Another male student is behind me and kisses the back of my neck and says, ""Oh Mama,"" in a sexy, teasing way. I whirl, angry, and grab him by the shirt. ""How dare you?"" I say. I yank him around and am dragging him off to my office to give him a talking to. I say to someone, ""You come with me, I don't want to be alone in the room with him,"" but the person says, ""I have to do something"" and leaves. I yell for a student, a girl, and I say, ""Get me Judith or any woman counselor, quick."" The student starts edging away as I keep a hold on his shirt and I notice one leg is an amputated stump. I yank him back and say, ""Oh no you don't."" Now another man, a counselor, comes toward me and tries to bump us with a cart/table. I say, ""What are you doing?"" He says, like a mad man, ""I am your father figure,"" and runs the cart up against me. I push back and manage to grab a bunch of his wiry blonde hair out of his head and I say ""Well, you are going bald"" (the hair reminds me of Blake). He keeps after me and I now am running away from him, dragging this poor student with me. I race through the room where the students are, they are getting ready for the meeting and someone says, ""It's 7:30, get ready for the meeting,"" and two of them are upset because they will miss Star Trek.

They like that idea. I see Howard; he left my check where he had been sitting. It had numbers written on it like he was figuring out some bills. He takes it and says, ""Oh no you don't,"" and finds a phone to call someone about details. I continue running and I see the mad man still after me and gaining fast.

This dream was not recalled on awakening, but was recalled in the following way: I was standing outside, talking to Bruce Jones, and he was telling me how mad he was on moving into their new house the day before to find that the previous tenants had ripped out both telephones (master & extension) and taken them away, stolen them. But he had hooked up an extension phone he owns (illegally, or course) and found the line still live, so he could call out. I started to warn him that he had better be sure to disconnect his phone before the phone company repairmen came out, when the following dream came back to me. In the dream I was in a house (don't know what house) in which the phones (a master and at least one extension -- don't recall how many extensions or whether it was just one) were not working. They were broken or disconnected, or something like that. I or someone (don't recall exactly) had illegally hooked my (their) own phone set up to the lines, and that worked OK. But I was thinking to myself, or warning someone else (not sure which) to disconnect it before the repairmen came. I cannot see any reason for dreaming about telephones in terms of day residue. I had not been to their new house, nor heard anything about it.","1MKA, 2JKA, 1ISA, 1ISA",AN 1MKA

She said nothing to me but was working on wearing a cordless phone, which was made to fit into a carry bag of sorts that was to be worn over the shoulder. The base with the numbers was carried in the back part and the speaker/receiver in the front. She was working closely with a sales associate named Nicki T. I reminded her that the phone is only for the store manager and store business. She just shrugged her shoulders. I took her into the back room of the store to talk with her about the apology and other related things. This wasn't our real backroom. It looked like the backroom of the drug stores where I used to work. We were sitting across from each other at a 6ft. table. As we were talking someone just appeared sitting in a chair next to me. I did not recognize her. She told me she was an angel. She was a large woman with very long, permed, light brown hair, which she wore parted in the middle and hanging straight down. I asked Nicki T if she saw her and Nicki T said yes. I asked why she was here and she said to help me. One of the first issues I began talking to Nicki T about was doing markdowns the correct way. I told her she had to do the items in the backroom as well. She wanted to know why and explained to her that was the only way for those things to be correctly priced when they went to the sales floor. As I was explaining this, I saw the section of the backroom where all baby products were stored. I remember seeing baby powder and Vaseline in particular but there was a long row of such products. We then went on to the way she is managing the sales associate Nicki T and the example she sets. She had been trying to keep Nicki T away from me. I reminded her that she is not the store manager, she cannot keep employees from me, and she must set a good example for the staff. She gave me the look she always does when she gets an attitude and said something but I don't know what. I asked the angel how I was doing and she said fine, patted me on the arm, and smiled reassuringly. Four new people appeared. A man, women, a girl, and a boy. I did not know them and asked them who they were. They, too, said they were angels there to offer me their support. They patted me on the shoulder and then said hello to the other angel touching her on the shoulder. They remained standing directly behind me and the other angel. I asked Nicki T if she saw them and she said yes. Someone else walked by and I asked them the same thing and they said yes. I wanted to reassure myself that I wasn't just seeing them because I wanted to. I ended my conversation with Nicki T by saying I wasn't going to put up with anymore. I told her that even though it might make my life much more difficult at least temporarily that the next time she screwed around with policy I would terminate her. She acted as though she didn't believe me and I told her she better, because I would. She left the room. I turned to the first angel, the others were now gone though I don't remember them leaving. I asked the angel how she thought I did and she said I did the right thing and I had done fine. I asked her how God thought I did. She said I didn't need him to tell me that. I said but I want to know that he thinks I did the right thing. She said she would ask him, she closed her eyes, within seconds she had a smile on her face. Then she chuckled a little. When she opened her eyes, she said he wants me to ask when I need help but other than that, I don't need his constant reassurance on matters like this. After this was over, I called my friend Jennifer K to tell her about my angel experience. I was so excited that I had an angel encounter. We talked about it a bit but I don't remember any of it. The next thing I knew I was in a large office, supposedly of the company where I work but the surroundings were not familiar to me. A lawyer approached me and said he was representing the sales associate Nicki T. I told him he would have to wait for a few minutes before I spoke to him. I knew I needed to try to get in touch with a company representative before talking to an attorney. I remember asking some of the office workers why Nicki T would need or want an attorney and what were going on because I didn't feel that I knew what was going on. None of them knew what had happened that she would have an attorney either. We were trying unsuccessfully to find a corporate person to give me approval to talk with the attorney or to provide our own attorney. Nicki T's attorney asked me why I felt I needed an attorney present to talk with him. I replied that it was not wise for me to speak with an attorney regarding company business without consulting our own company attorney first. As I was looking for our company attorney or human resource person or someone I said perhaps I should go to the sister company office next door and see if someone there could help. The office staff at my office did not know whom I would talk to there so they were trying to find out. While I was waiting, I went into one of the back offices. There were quite a few other people in this room. I was told that everyone in there was being punished by being put on a game show. One of the people in the room was actor/director Ron Howard. He had put on several different costumes and was required to do comedy routines in each one. He was with two other people in each of these routines. The final routine each of the two people he was with was required to light a huge firecracker of sorts. One person lit his on the top and it sparked a bit and then fizzled. The other lit his from the bottom and it shot off into the air. Someone said that is what you were supposed to do with them, so the first guy lit his at the bottom and it took off into the air. Both firecrackers were flying around the office in and out of hallways and doors. I crouched to the floor to avoid being hit. Someone said that was the whole purpose of lighting them, to avoid being hit by them.","1FKA, 1MOA, 1FSA, 2ISA, 1MSA",

I'm not dressed, either, and I grab a robe and try to get myself covered up in case I'm discovered, and when I see she really is making for the stairs I fumble into the back and try to hide under something. Apparently she goes away, though, and my friends come in. We talk about the plants. I still want to know if I can plant the poinsettias, and I think (Mike?) might know, but he's not sure himself.

8055,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,0265,1999-,2001-07-27,F,A,"I had been on the phone with Doctor Pf's office. He had gotten a call from a patient who was insisting he do surgery and Doctor Pf said he wasn't a surgeon and he didn't agree with the decision to have the surgery anyway. But he said if he was going to do the surgery he had to have someone assisting him. The surgery was going to be on a little boy and the mother was being very adamant because without surgery the child could die. So I had called Doctor C to see if he would do it. It was 4:30 am when I called and he was very pleasant to talk to for that time of morning and for receiving a call at home. He said no problem. He found out from me who the patient was and where to go and then said he would be there. Later I drove to his house and I was going to spend the night there, but it was later that morning. I got there just as he was getting ready to leave. We chatted very briefly and then he kissed me on the lips and left. I was quite surprised by that, that he did that. I stayed at the house while he left to go do this surgery. I heard Sara C coming so I grabbed a blanket and lay down on the floor behind the sofa and pretended to be asleep. The sofa didn't sit next to a wall. She knelt on the sofa and looked over and saw me lying there. She said something to me and I pretended to be half-asleep. I said I was laying here reading and I fell asleep so I just stayed here. She insisted that I get up and lay on the sofa. She was on her way out. I watched her leave and was thinking that Sara C just didn't seem like the type of woman Doctor C would be married to. They appeared to be an odd couple. Although, Sara C in the dream did not look at all like Sara C in waking life. After Sara C left the boys came down, they were maybe 5-7 years younger than in waking life. It was Jeff C and Ben C although Ben C said that was not his name. I don't remember now what he said it was. It was about time for me to get up already and I had just gotten to sleep. The boys stayed there and wanted to talk and play. So I did. I talked to them and gave them a lot of attention. I realized then that I had to get ready and get to work. I had seen a shower on wheels at the bottom of the driveway. I went out and pushed it to the top of the driveway and it rolled off the edge of the driveway and into the grass. I thought that was probably too far so I pulled it back out of the grass. I was trying to figure out a way to use it so no one would see me naked. It looked like a bathtub with two walls on the ends but nothing on either side. The walls on the ends were not very wide and got narrower towards the top. I realized if I turned it one way the neighbors would see me and if I turned it the other way the cars driving by would see me. I realized that I didn't bring my shampoo and stuff with me so I was going to go back in the house to get it. At that point I saw the shower wasn't even in Doctor C's driveway but in someone else's. So I walked back into the house and I asked someone which shower I should use. They said they didn't have a shower in the house. They said there was supposed to be one in one room but Doctor C made it into his poolroom and so there wasn't one in there I could use. I really wanted to take a shower and get cleaned up before I went to work. I asked someone if I could see the house. There were quite a few people around and they weren't sure if they should let me see the house. I said I was sure it was okay because I worked for Doctor C and he and I had a very good relationship and he had invited me to see the house previously and I hadn't been able to make it. They finally agreed. This house was just incredible. Much of it had an almost sci-fi appearance to it. Contemporary! Cool! Unusual! Yet some rooms were fairly traditional. There is no way I can come close to describing this accurately. The office was fairly traditional. Very large room with lots of dark wood. Very masculine in appearance. Then we started to go into this other room. It was as if the walls had different levels to them, almost like upside down stair steps. But they kept moving. As you tried to enter an area the wall would come down and block you. I tried to get down and crawl under but didn't make it that way either. Someone said you had to push a button to stop them so you could get in. This was Doctor C's own private room and he did that so that other people couldn't get in. I finally found one of the buttons and pushed it and then saw a red door. So I held the button while I got as close to the door as I could and then made a dash for the door. I got through. I don't even remember now what was in this room. We were going from one room to another and we had to get in this monorail type of transport. The house looked like it was a city block in size and it seemed to be located in an area similar to Las Vegas. A lot of neon lights. As we were riding we were outdoors and I could see his house was hidden by lots of trees and greenery. We were going up to the 7th floor and there was a section of wall that was octagon shaped. On each section of the octagon was an elevator door and the octagon was going around in a circle. So you had to try to push the button while it was going around. I finally did. Several of the other people got in the elevator and I couldn't get in quick enough, so myself and another person got in another one that opened. Someone said room 7 to get the elevator to take us where we wanted to go instead of pushing a button on the inside. The elevator itself was shaped kind of like a space module that astronauts return to earth in. And it didn't go up and down but it went sideways and at angles. At another point we were in, maybe his playroom. He was there and not dressed at all like he would normally dress. He kissed me again and this time it was more passionate. He started to pull my blouse up and I stopped him and said no we can't do that. Things still progressed a bit. We did end up making love. Then all of a sudden I wasn't with him again and we were looking at some other rooms in the house. The ninth floor I believe. There was a big open area of marble floor and marble steps, green I think. It was a huge area and I thought this is just such a huge house. The steps here were a half circle, very wide, and fairly tall. I thought, no wonder it takes him so long to answer the door or to go from one room to another. I remember going up the steps but I don't remember where they led. There was another place in the house similar to that. I was spending time with his boys and we were playing and laughing and having a good time. They were really enjoying being with me and the attention. It was time for me to go and I wanted to hurry and leave before Doctor C saw me. So the boys were trying to help me get my things together and out to the car. As I was almost at the car, Doctor C came out.","1MOA, 1FSC, 1MKA, 1FKA, 2MKA",CO D

I don't think I know this person in waking life. My mother is supposed to be getting me ready to go over there and it's about 6:00 p.m. and she's moving really slowly. (I don't know what she has to do). I go upstairs and see some books I don't have in the bookcase behind my bed. One of them is a book version of the movie ""Election,"" hardcover, and priced over $20. I thought that maybe my grandmother had bought it for me. My mother is still in the bathroom doing something or other (probably getting herself ready to bring me), and there's toast in the toaster for a sandwich. I hear my brother leave the house, and then see there's only one piece of toast in the toaster. I'm really in a hurry now, and my mother yells at my brother who's walking down the street. He pretends not to hear and when she calls again he runs like 5 feet away and then looks back to listen to her. I'm not sure what she said but I don't think it was about my toast! I don't remember what happened then, except that I went down to the bottom of the street to catch a ride to school from some seniors from last year- I remember Wesley and others. The car looks like a convertible, and we're driving down the street. All of a sudden, I remember thinking, ""We've been driving here a while.

I wasn't really lucid, but I wasn't aware of the time we'd been driving down the road until I sort of realized I was in a dream.

I say the ""LW"" and ""Ra"" to myself several times.

I try to make my sounding of the words ""purely mental"" so as not to disturb anyone. The vowel sounds had two effects: (1) I sailed back and forth thru the air from the front door to the kitchen much more rapidly than before (every couple of seconds or so) as if I were gathering energy to break thru the walls and out; and (2) my position changed from horizontal on my stomach to one in which my feet were straight up in the air and I sailed up thru the ceiling and 50 feet or more into the sky. (Memory is somewhat fuzzy from here on) Although I was now up in the sky, I could not see anything, for my eyes were closed. I tried hard to open my ""astral"" eyes, but couldn't. There was a strong sensation of my physical eyelids straining (sense of dual consciousness was strong here), and I was afraid they would open and wake me. At one point there was a flash of light in my right eye, as if it had opened momentarily (on reflection, I believe the room was actually almost perfectly dark at the time of this dream), and this discouraged me from further trying.

20937,melora,Melora (Melvin's wife),147,1962,2063-02-01,F,Y,"I dreamed I was in a very large library, and it was set up in the form of a huge rectangular room, with all of the books stored off of this room on different levels. And there was a small restaurant near the end of the library that I was at, with mostly very small booths. And the people who were there were mostly people who had been in the French class I audited last semester. And a bear was going to be let loose in this library, and it was going to be following this father and his little child, his little child being around 3 or 4 years old. And he was supposed to try get away from it. And in the dream for a while I was sort of watching this, and sort of identified with it. The bear actually was never very close to this man and his child he was carrying on his shoulders. But he was running in and out of the little tables there in the restaurant, and generally dodging around thru this immense room in the library. And you could see the bear. It was down at the other end of the library, and it was so far away that it, well, it looked very small, but of course you knew it was an ordinary-sized bear. And then the bear was chasing me. And I decided that a better way to get rid of it would be to go back into the stacks of the library, that there would be more places that you could dodge and hide in there. And there were some sort of tunnels, round-tunnels isn't exactly the word because they went up and down, and they had staircases in them, but they were sort of spiral staircases, only much narrower than usual spiral staircases are -- which went from level to level, and they were for the use of the library staff, and they were completely enclosed, except at the tops of each level. And they were closed, if I remember correctly, at the top, with some sort of a bag or something that you stuffed down into the top after you had gone thru. And so I was going thru, and pulling these bags or whatever, these stuffed bags, into the opening after I got in. And they were very narrow stairs, because it wasn't much bigger around, there wasn't any leeway on either side. But I would go down, and this bear -- even though it was much bigger than I was -- seemed to be able to follow me fairly easily. And there were elevators also that went from level to level, and I thought, well, naturally a bear wouldn't know how to take an elevator, and might go on one of those if I found one. And so I did, and I went down to the 14th level, because I remembered that I needed to look for a certain magazine. I believe I was looking for it for my husband, and I thought it would be found on this level. It also had something to do with the French course that I had been auditing, and so it seems rather hard to see how my husband could have been interested in it. But I started looking for the magazines, and the bear sort of dropped out of the picture entirely. And I was just looking for this particular magazine, which would have been a big one, called the American something, full of all these lush pictures and everything. But I never did find it.","2JKA, 1MKA, 1ANI, 2MOC, 1ANI",

Early in the dream Carly had been kidnapped. Her boyfriend, Jack, who is a police officer, found her, but didn't tell anyone right away that he found her. They made love. I don't know why he didn't tell anyone that he found her. Later she, or I, am with a young college boy. Some other woman found out that she/I was kind of seeing this young college man. He was into computers. That's what he was studying. I'm in this room with this other woman. There are empty boxes under this cabinet. One of them is evidence that he is using AOL. The other is evidence of where I/Carly am. This other woman realized that Jack had found me but didn't tell anyone. She also knew that this man wasn't supposed to be using AOL at school so she wanted to expose both of us. I was trying to get her not to. I'm not sure why. I hid the box that would let people know that Jack had found me. I kind of stashed in towards the back of the cabinet behind something else. I did the same thing with the AOL. Now the college man is working on a project with some classmates. I see his laptop sitting. We're in a mall now but he is sitting with all of these six-foot long folding tables. His laptop is sitting on one of these tables at the front of the room right by the door. There is a big red button on the front that says AOL. It's maybe 1 by 2 inches long. It identifies that he uses AOL. I saw it and knew that it had something to do with this woman who wanted to expose him so I turned it off. I hesitated to interrupt him because he was working with his classmates but decided to anyway. I went up to his left side and bent down and tapped him. He leaned back in his chair and I whispered to him what I had just noticed. He wasn't all that concerned about it. I told him that this woman wanted to expose him but he just wasn't that concerned. Now I'm going through a large department store in the mall. I'm on the first floor and I'm walking through a children's clothing department. I go to the escalator. The two escalators, up and down, are divided by steps. It is a really steep staircase so I decided to take the escalators. Instead of steps on the escalator it is flat like a people mover but it goes up. I get on there and I stand to the left. I reached for the rail but there is a woman who is taking the steps at the same time and she grabs the escalator handrail. Since this is so steep I know I am going to need to hold on so I grab the right handrail. I was kind of irritated that this woman who was walking up the steps was in such good shape that she was keeping up with the escalator. I was upset because I didn't think I was in good enough shape to do that. I moved over to the right of the escalator so I could hold on to that handrail. The escalators were much wider than they are in waking life. Still, as it gets to the top I have to exert a lot of energy and strength to hold on and get to the top. I almost have to pull myself off. Then you walk a few feet and there is another incline and handrail and I have to hold on to that handrail as I walk up this other shorter yet steep incline. I have to pull myself along to get up that one. I finally got up there and I'm walking around. I think I'm in the women clothing department now. The college man shows up and is walking with me. We're walking through the various departments and he starts reading something to me that he found. It's a piece of literature or something that someone had written. It has lots of adjectives. It's very sensory. It talks about smells and sights and such. I thought it was very nicely written and I especially liked all the sensory details. He was kind of making fun of it. I asked him if he had ever really paid attention to the sensory experiences in his life, the smells, the sights, the sounds. He kind of laughed. I said I guess that's a difference in our age. I am 20 something years older than you. I started thinking about that or maybe I was talking to someone about it. Isn't it fairly common for very young men to fantasize about being with an older woman and maybe that's all this was for him. Maybe his desire to be with me was maybe just fulfilling some fantasy, wanting to experience lovemaking with an older woman, what an older woman might teach him about romance and intimacy.","1FKA, 1MKA, 1FSA, 2ISA",

Dora had baked 7 kinds of fake pastries and cakes (they looked real but you could not eat them--they were to be thrown and hit with plates for good luck.

All the walls were pink and stuccoed, and the barista stood behind this hole in the wall where he took your orders. Well, Dylan grabbed a 1-liter Coke and left the money on the counter, but I didn't want so much soda, so I ordered a can of Pepsi and set some quarters on the counter. Turns out the guy who ran the place was John of John's Liquors down by Eastern High School. I leaned through the hole in the wall to place my order and saw Jack sitting there, not really doing anything besides staring off into space. He took a shot of whiskey and ignored me. Then I noticed his entire extended family in the back of the cafe: his grandparents, sleeping in bed, his parents, and so on. Then, of all people, Elizabeth Church came in through the back door and gave Jack a very loving hug, just as though they had been married and were totally in love despite the 30-year age difference. Eventually Elizabeth got me my soda and I thanked her, and talked with her a while, updating her on what was going on in my life and trading info and so on. Then Dylan and I left the cafe; he waved goodbye to Elizabeth, and we walked out onto the street, which had become a field of wildflowers in the meantime. We walked through the field and I told Dylan I was going to visit that cafe more frequently in the future, since I knew so many people who hung around it, including him and Elizabeth, whereas in other cafes I went to nobody knew me at all. I told him about everything going on in my life, my plans, my book, my girlfriend (soon to be wife).

I was thinking very intentionally about this. Even though we were going to be sharing this house I certainly wasn't going to share my bed. I did think, momentarily, about reconciliation, and thought immediately. Oh, NO! NO WAY! Then I wondered why such a thought would even occur to me because it just repulses me to consider that. We bought it from Margie D and Dennis D, initially. They said they were moving and I said, maybe I should buy it from you. After I moved in it seems that there was someone else involved. I noticed that the paint in some of the rooms was still the same color as when I had owned it previously. There was a listing in the paper for the house and it said two bedrooms and a loft. I laughed that they called the third bedroom a loft because it was no different than the other two rooms. It was a one-story house. In the one room, all the walls were kind of like sponge painted. I looked up and they had done the ceiling too. I realized they had done it to look like clouds. I thought maybe I could leave the ceiling like that. Then I noticed that on the ceiling they had used stuffed animals. One of the stuffed animals was a Teddy Bear. On the walls they had made the white parts look like butterflies. In one room they had a big splotch of paint. In one room there was a framed picture attached to the middle of the ceiling. In another room there were two things attached to the ceiling, not necessarily in the middle and not aligned but a seemingly random placement. They were abstract in design but after studying them I realized they said LE1. I didn't know what this was and then someone brought a bottle of men's cologne in. It was called LE1. A man sprayed it all over himself and we still couldn't smell it. I said I hadn't heard of it before. Audrey T and Karen Mc were there. Audrey T had done something and she was embarrassed. I hugged her head and kissed her on the head and told her I loved her. The third room I was making my office. It's like I was sharing it with Karen Mc. There were several windows in that room. I was excited to get that room just the way I wanted it. It was spacious. not like in waking life. Someone had moved all the furniture in without me guiding them. I was anxious to begin moving the furniture around. I told Karen Mc and someone else how I was going to set up my desk and credenza by the window. But I was going to set up the desk so it was coming out from the wall into the center of the room. Probably have my computer facing the window. Karen Mc said she figured I would do that and since it was my house she couldn't really say anything. I said, well, maybe we can have your sewing machine by the other window.","1MKA, 1FKA, 1MSA, 1MSA, 1FKA, 2ISA","CO D, AP 1MKA"

He had proposed something to me, perhaps relationship. He had offered me a ring and I had refused it but I am fascinated and want to go get the ring. So I keep putting the woman from England off with excuses about being busy, or it's too early to take a coffee break and so on. She persists. Finally, I say, ""No. You go on ahead without me.""

They were talking about how the place was had at a good price partially because someone died on the stairs years before. A roll of tape or something dropped and rolled out the door and went down the stairs and stopped halfway down. The pregnant sister went after it. For some reason, nails covered the stairs. Some were sticking up without explanation. The sister got a foreboding feeling and told her pregnant sister to hold onto the rail. The wood on the steps was scratched and had chunks missing from it. She reached for the door, but the seam was gone. It wouldn't open. But then she double took. The seam was back. She opened the door and let the light and outside air come in. She led her sister by the hand to the bottom and outside. She insisted the stay there for a while. The pregnant sister thought she was being silly. Then very sinister sounding rock music with a steady, deep drum and base picked up just inside normal hearing range. There were noises of sex and violence intertwined. She looked inside and felt death. The older sister ran with her younger sister to her old car parked out front, got in, and started driving. The younger sister was starting to get afraid after her initial reaction of skepticism.

I lept from the cliff onto the pine trees below after fleeing from the shoe store with the glow-print eating nerd hipster idiots. One tried on a hat in this abandoned store. They were roaming around earlier, looking for food and other items in the fields like cattle. Irradiated patches of wheat and mushrooms. As I was running away from the guarded main road, I came across a band of them. I ran with them as the other terminators came after me. In the store, the idiots put in a DVD and messed around with the phones, which they didn't know how to use. They probably didn't get killed because they were idiots. Later I went out and tried to escape in a truck that had been there fueling for months, with the nozzle still in the gas tank. The truck and other vehicles were soon ripped apart by the other terminators -- which were more looming and massive than I'd seen before. I tried to run down the road. They followed. I ducked into the brush alongside the road. I had a feeling that I could not escape, no matter which way I ran or how far.  Dream went into a transition, as I was a bare skeleton without skin; it had all gotten peeled off as I fell from the cliff and into the pine trees. I had run and jumped off a cliff and got skinned on the way down. I wanted to get into a stasis to heal. I was just an exposed skeleton with chunks of flesh attached, even my spine. But it was all heavy, articulated metal. I arrived at the bank of a lake or river near a school. This whole town was playing baseball by the river; it was on the edge of the city.

We're going somewhere for an outing, just starting, and I'm realizing I have to go back for something. It may be just to put makeup on, because I haven't done that today. We go back to the kid's house - not mine - I'm staying there as a guest, and this outing is in the nature of babysitting. The house is rather suburban ranch-style, one floor, attached garage, rather upscale, yucca plants and stone outside. I pull up next to the garage, and a man either comes out or is waiting and takes the kid inside. He's maybe a friend of the family, or a relative, middle-aged, nice, helpful. I'm sitting in the driver's seat, taking out some toner and a cotton ball - I think I'll try to get my makeup off in the car, dash in and throw a face on - we're actually not so much in a hurry, but we want to make this stop quick and get back on the road. I decide the toner isn't such a great idea and get out of the car. When I open the door, a can (or something - it sounds like a can) falls out and rolls into the open garage. There are large hanging things (the size of meat carcasses, but they're not). I'm concerned about having to dig around in there to find anything, especially if it's just an empty can, but a couple of steps and I see there's not that much on the floor and the can is just a little way under something. I get it and bring it back, and go on into the house. The house is furnished the way the outside looks - rather like Joan's - semi-modern, slightly upscale, open space, clean, glass table tops. The parents of this kid are a youngish couple that match the house - she's got shoulder-length blonde hair and looks nonchalant. They're just sitting down to dinner and they say as long as we're here, why not just stay and eat, then go back out? Sounds pretty sensible to me.","1ISC, 1MSA, 2JKA",AP D

20852,melora,Melora (Melvin's wife),062,1962,2062-07-21,F,Y,"I dreamed that I had another baby. It was a little girl too and I guess it looked a great deal like my daughter did when she was a baby. When I came home, I came home to a funny place. I don't know where it was. But an old woman who used to look after me and my brother and my sister when we were about 6, 7 and 8, had come to help me take care of my new little girl. She was about the same age as she was then, which I guess was nearly 50. I decided the new baby would sleep in this little crib we had just the way that my daughter had for quite a while. I wanted to fix it up so we would be sure she would never slip out of it. I had this idea of tacking screen sort of humped around the edge of it to sort of form a cocoon-like thing that you slip her into and you could put the blanket on the outside of it and it wouldn't bog down around her and yet she would be protected from drafts at the same time. Also she couldn't fall out of the crib. This old lady who was there didn't think that was a very good thing to do. I was wondering what to name our little girl because we hadn't much thought our second little baby would be a girl and we hadn't thought of any names. I thought of naming her Bonnie, which is my sister's name, but I didn't really know if I liked that or not. Then it seems I was going with my new little baby and my next door neighbor. I was in my university town and I was going over to campus. Exactly why I was, I don't know. I think she had to do something in the language office there since her husband is a graduate student in Spanish. I was just more or less going with her. When we got there, the professor that I had for French last semester was there. Somebody told them to look at the baby. So he was looking and I was asking what name I should give it. He didn't particularly have any ideas. He didn't look like a professor looks in real life at all. He looked more like the doctor I was working for in the Biology Dept. right before I had my daughter. At any rate, he took me out in the hall and started congratulating me on the final that I did in his class, and how good it was and how hardly anybody else had done any better. Of course, this made me feel very good because I consider this professor the best that I've ever had anyhow. I told him, which is so, that I wanted to audit one of his courses next fall. He said that would be fine. Then I went back into the office and there were on a little table, there were several samples of some rock, they called it jade. It wasn't really jade. It was some form of quartz, more like opal. This other girl was ready to go, but I was sort of attracted by this display, and I wanted to stay and look at it for a little while, but we left. I believe that was all of that dream or else it faded into this which is a very independent sort of thing in which I was at home in my hometown, that is, with this old friend of mine from grammar school and high school that I never particularly liked. We were over in the high school where I had gone to school, but it was different. It had been so long ago that I had been there or something or they were in a new building. We were in some part of the building, and we went into a little room where we were going to study for a quiz or something. This was the math building and it seems she was majoring in math. I thought that was a little strange, but we went out for something. I didn't stay in there for only a couple of minutes. I don't know what we were going to do, but we went upstairs somewhere and she said she was going back to get our books. I would have gone back with her, but I didn't feel much like running back, then coming back here and running up the stairs and everything, so I said I'd wait right there, and she said she'd be back in a few minutes. While I was waiting, I noticed this boy along the wall right in front of me, and it also went around the corner and continued on down. This was the math part of this building, but I also think there was a science part, and I think this corridor led toward the science part. I started looking at this display, which was very strange. It was made up of incidents from a science fiction story which in the dream I had read, but in actuality I don't believe I have. It was of various things. There was a picture of the solar system. There were sculptures of this and that, all sorts of things. It was sort of confusing. I was looking at it. It occurred to me that I had been watching it for some while. This girl hadn't come back, and I figured she had probably just gotten her own books and had gone. It made me sort of mad and upset me because I wasn't at all sure of my way around this building and I wasn't sure I could find my way back to the room we had been in, but I went down the stairs and started walking along, and there was this man. He was evidently an instructor or professor walking along, and he had a limp. I walked along beside him and told him I was looking for this room, but the first room which had double doors that we came to I opened and looked. Then I noticed there were booths as though it was some sort of restaurant or something. So I went on and looked in several rooms. None of them were it. Finally we came to the end of the hall and then I found a room which I opened. It didn't much look like the room we'd been in, but I thought it just had to be. But there were painters in there painting and there wasn't any sign of any books. So I asked them if they had seen any books, and put them away when they had started painting, and they said yes, they had. I asked them where they had put them. They had put them in a back corner when they had already painted under this canvas. So I said when could I get them because I need them right now, that it was very urgent. So they got them for me. When they got them for me, the scene sort of changed and there was a counter there and this woman had gotten the books. I was with some friend now, this friend Edna of ours from N.J. This woman was showing my friend these books and saying look, what fine books these are. And they were magazines. It seems as though they were copies of some we had taken or are taking. There was a copy of Science, Atlas, and some other strange magazines which weren't very impressive. I was telling her and this American Indian who had appeared somehow on the other side of her, about his article that appeared in one of these magazines about Indians. There was a very complicated game in one of these magazines. It was a game that really I didn't understand, but I had played one round of it or something with somebody. In the game there were three, it was a piece of paper, in this case it was a page in a magazine, in which there was a square formed by three figures of various types of people or in various, not exactly situations, but you could infer what type of people or what type of action they normally engaged in by the pictures, and there were three figures across and three down, so there were nine in all. The object was to get to one of these and to get there, you would mark over them or something in your choice, and you were supposed to have these figures end up in the form of a cross such that the figures in all parts of the cross represented how the one in the center had come to be the way the one in the center was. It was a very, rather confusing. It was very clear in the dream. This particular one that I had ended up with somebody who was crucified and it was an Indian. The Indian by friend's side said that I seem to understand perfectly how somebody came to end up this way because of the ones I had chosen to go along with it. I said that I was going to show him this article in this other magazine that I had which was about a certain tribe of American Indians and their ceremonies, which included a sort of ritual crucifixion, only it wasn't. It wasn't with nails or on a cross; it was on a tree. I was finding this article for her and I think that was the end of the dream.","1FKC, 1FKA, 1MKA, 1FKA, 1MKA, 1ISA",

I saw him in the mirror and my heart fluttered. I kept doing sit-ups and all of a sudden I was at the off-campus boys lacrosse team's house with Kit. We were dancing and kissing and it was fun. Then it was senior week (the week of festivities leading up to graduation) and I was running to the library in a blue dress. I think all the seniors had to gather there. I burst through the doors in the library and realized I was drunk. It was a strange feeling, because I think what I had been nervous about before was being late, not drunk. Kit was there wearing a pink and white striped haberdashery shirt and he hugged me and bemoaned the fact that we had never dated at college. He said he wanted to see me next week after we graduated, but I didn't want to for some reason. The inside of the library was constructed in a sort of Frank Lloyd Wright-esque way, in that there were all these steel rafters and open staircase shafts. The building was minimalist and modern and blended in with the environment so perfectly that the ocean waves were swelling up and crashing into the library walls. All of a sudden, I guess the entire setting changed and we were on Pandora, the planet in Avatar. There was a huge wave swelling up about to crash over, and I had to run all the way up to the top of the wave before it crested. I think I did, but then all of a sudden I'm right back in the middle of senior week. Alondra is doing stand-up comedy, but no one is laughing. I am waiting to hear the punch line to this piece she is doing, but I can feel myself waking up. I fight consciousness so hard until I hear the punch line, which was, ""The musical, Les Miserables.""

She said, ""I've been crying in there for 10 minutes,"" is how she came out. My hopes flew. Did she break up with him? I asked, ""Oh, no-- how come?"" ""It's just wrong what they're doing to them -- I have to do something to stop it."" I was disappointed, but jumped at the chance to help her with something. ""No matter what, I'll help you get this done."" She began the quest. She was the leader -- and a lot of liberal volunteers stepped in to help her. They began by running through the base -- there would only be one chance to stop it. There was a great robotic AI cyborg in there. Me, I moved along with the group -- unsure what the plan was -- but I was going to support them the whole way. I had more attack power and defense than any of them. I got too ahead and lost my way and fell down somewhere and had to re-spawn -- to join the group it required one of two crappy pistol-type weapons. I had them, but wondered why you needed loot to join. I thought, as I killed a creature, ""is there xp sharing?"" I thought, ""no,"" the level range is too great. I found several of them, including the second in command in an elevator/puzzle room. There were tiles that supposedly had to be stepped on in a certain order. One of the people had been working and memorizing for hours. I stepped on the tiles and barely made it up to the centerpiece as the girl had her hand on my head. She was supposed to be helping, but she was preventing me from jumping. I knocked her hand off and jumped and stretched and made it up. She was nice enough... As it turned out, just as I thought, it was not an elaborate puzzle at all -- it was a lift system power coupling. I pulled the switch and the thing exploded. I jumped out of the way and everyone was ok. We then approached the main gate, where I knew the showdown would take place... we were about to get inside when I woke up.","2FKA, 1ANI, 2JKA, 2JSA, 1CZZ, 2JSA, 1CZZ","AP D, SD D, CO D"

He's just gotten his ""belt"" in some form of martial art - or similar physical skill - and they give you this to display. (I guess that makes it a red belt.) He's very proud of this, brought us to look at it for a surprise. I'm pleased for him, but not especially excited, and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of point to just standing here and looking at a piece of red cloth. I wonder how soon I can get away, without hurting his feelings. Besides, I have to go to the bathroom. There's a class about to start [I think it's a yoga class, and it's unclear whether I'm supposed to be in it or not] and I go past them, trying to be unobtrusive, to the bathroom at the other end of the room. (There are windows down here, letting in some soft midday-light. This is an oldish place, probably in a school. Everything's used-looking.) I go in and push the door to, but it won't latch. It has a standard brass turn-latch on it, and when you press on the door it seems like it goes in, but it doesn't. The toilet is just a little too far away to hold it shut comfortably. This is a problem. I start to sit down anyway, hoping nobody will come into the line of sight of the door (it just stands open maybe 6""-8""), but the whole class is called down to this end of the room for a demonstration.

21010,melvin,Melvin (Melora's husband),009,1962,2062-06-27,M,Y,"My wife and I and a number of other people are at some kind of party and there is another woman there who may be acting as the hostess, I'm not sure. I've been drinking some sort of wine throughout most of the evening and then she gives me some tequila or something like that to drink. As a result of drinking this, something happens to my mind, so that I'm now very stupid. I realize that this has happened once before and it takes months to wear off, and so I become quite angry at this woman. I have thoughts of getting back at her somehow and then this shades over into some other part of a dream in which I have been at a concert or athletic event in a big stadium. I go down to the ticket office afterwards. It seems that the music they played at the end of the event has made me a little bit deaf, dumb again. I go down to the ticket office to complain about this. I give them some kind of brown paper envelope. Then there's a somewhat confused series of events in which the envelope apparently is full of tickets which the ticket people have not actually sold. But somehow they worked out some kind of deal where they could get some money and have some tickets left over, and they just had to get rid of the tickets, and they mentioned something about having to throw the tickets out every once in a while. This shades over into a part of the dream where this envelope is full of money. I and several other people have robbed a bank or somehow gotten this money illegally. We're running away. We run into a Catholic church which I ha  dreamed about before. I don't recall if I've ever been in one like it in real life, but I've dreamed about this particular church. We are hiding in this church. A priest comes in for a while, and a janitor and some cleaning women, and we're sneaking around trying to make sure we're not noticed by these people. Finally, one or two cleaning women notice us, and one of the people with me who robbed this bank or whatever we did to get the money, is a woman, and she offers to bribe them. First she offers them five dollars if she'll forget they've seen us, then $10, then she offers them $100 each right then and another $100 tomorrow. I argue with her that that will call a lot of suspicion to us because she is giving them such a big amount. Then I don't recall what happened immediately after that, but it shifts over to a scene in which I have the envelope with the money in it. I'm running away from everybody else. I don't know what happened to the people that were involved in getting the money with me, but there are some other crooks trying to get the money away from me. I'm up in a big balcony in this church and they're down below. I don't think they know where I am, but one person is coming up the stairs. The balcony is made of canvas as I recall, and it's a little bit unstable. It's made of canvas and it's unstable; it's green canvas. There's another one right below it also made of canvas. These other people who are after me start driving their car up into the lower one, and I don't think it will hold, but it does. It shakes quite a bit, but they drive their car up into the first one to the far end where a ramp up to the second one is, where I am. They start driving up that. For some reason they don't drive up to the second one after all, even though they started. One man is coming up onto the 2nd balcony. I have a hypodermic syringe in my hand filled with sodium amatol or sodium pentothal, one of the barbiturates that's rather quick-acting. I think that when the man gets up there, I'll plunge it in where I think there's a vein and inject it very quickly and knock him out that way. I have some doubts as to whether this will be quick enough, but apparently I don't have any other choice. So the man's head comes up the stairway, I quickly inject it and he doesn't struggle much, and I manage to inject it. A few seconds later he falls over and is passed out. Again, following this, there are a few intermediate events which I don't recall. Then I'm on the run with this envelope full of money and there's a woman with me, about my own age. I don't know who she is, but I know she is involved with me in stealing from the crooks. The crooks are after us. She and I have apparently planned to steal this money for quite a while in advance. We've set up some kind of sunbathing club or something like that. We come to this very tall brick building, almost windowless, and it is part of this sunbathing club we've set up. We climb right up the vertical wall of the building. There are some little cracks left in the bricks, apparently purposely, and we climb up onto the roof, open the trap door which reveals two chutes, side by side, going down about 8 or 9 feet into a little hidden room inside there. There are a few people scattered here and there on the roof sunbathing and I hope that they won't see us. So we slide down into the room and close the trap doors above us after us. This is a temporary hideaway and we plan to go on from here and get away even further. but the woman decides we should stay there, that we're really quite safe there, and no one would ever find us. I tell her no, that some people have probably seen us going in from the roof and we have to go on. It's part of the plan. We have a little argument about it. Finally I decide to go on, and she's going to stay there. I give her half of the money and I also have a thought that in a way it's somewhat better that we're splitting up. It increases my chances of getting away. It also seems to have her going along with me. So I leave the room. I don't' recall what happened immediately after that, but I think the crooks cornered me again eventually and I was under another balcony. No, I'm not sure. There was a scene in there somewhere where I was under a canvas balcony and they were shooting with a machine gun through the canvas, and I was moving around so as not to be under the same part of the balcony. But that may have gone back to the previous scene where the balcony was. I'm not sure.","1FKA, 1FSA, 2ISA, 1MOA, 2FSA, 1FSA, 1FSA",AN D

8503,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,0713,1999-,2003-11-17,F,A,"I was at John Mu's house. He and his wife were in bed. He motioned me to come into his bedroom. Their bed was the width of a twin size bed but the length of two beds. They were sleeping feet-to-feet. I didn't even realize that she was in the bed until he started to introduce me to her and she poked her head out from under the blanket. They invited me to stay. We were in the living room watching a movie. He and his wife and I. He sat really close to me, right next to my left side. It made me very uncomfortable. His wife got up and left but I don't know where she went. Then he tried to get even cozier. Maybe he leaned his head against me. We were eating popcorn. I think I was trying to be nice to make up for the bad parting that we had in waking life. I had my hand interlaced in his arm. I was surprised when I realized that my head was leaning against his shoulder. I moved immediately. It was dark in the room. I could tell he was getting ready to reach over and put his hand on my leg or knee. I was getting very squeamish because I did not want him to touch me. He reached over and I gently pushed his hand away. I was wearing a skirt. He said, Oh come on. It's not like I'm going to reach all the way up or anything. I was still trying to be nice so I smiled and said, Sorry. I don't do that. He tried again and I pushed his hand away again. Then four children came in. Two of the teenage girls, with blonde hair, were his daughters. The one teenager was a boy and then there was a younger girl. He introduced me to them. They started watching the movie with us. The youngest one had long dark hair. I think I playfully tossed a pillow at her and it landed on her stomach. She got really upset. I apologized. I crouched down over her. She was lying on the sofa. She said she didn't feel good. I said again how sorry I was. She started crying. John went to do something and I just decided that it was time for me to leave. I picked up my purse but I didn't think I should leave without saying anything to him. As soon as he came back in the room I told him that I thought it was time for me to go. He started to protest and I just said, No. I really need to go. When I went to leave I saw my car was covered with a heavy layer of white dust or dirt. I think earlier we or someone had been doing yardwork and it was from the yardwork. I was parallel parked in the driveway between two other cars. I opened the driver's side door very carefully so all of this stuff wouldn't get in the car. I shut the door and started the engine. I was revving the engine really hard to blow all of this white dust off so I could see to drive. As I did this it shook the car a lot, enough to move it in a position where I could easily drive away. John came out and was going to try to stop me but I pulled away. It seemed that he and I worked for the same large company. I had a discussion with the owner of the company. It had nothing to do with John. I think it had to do with an idea that I had for the business. He kind of liked the idea and had suggested that I handle a certain part of the project. A couple of other people were standing there and questioning why I would want to do this. I was said a couple of times, No. I would like to finally be recognized for being the one responsible for this. I didn't come right out and say it or was hinting at the fact that at previous companies I had made significant contributions that really benefited the company but other people got credit for it. So this time I wanted to do it again and I wanted to get credit for it. I don't think that was the only reason I wanted to do it though. There was a rumor going around. A lot of employees were getting worried that they were going to lose their jobs. It was in some way related to this idea I proposed. It wasn't true but the rumor got started and everyone was getting worried. John was one of them. He was still kind of after me. The owner found out about that and was trying to help me. Maybe he was trying to protect me or keep John away from me. I was now maybe back at John's house and I was trying to get out without him seeing me. He would spot me and come running after me. I kept trying to hide and get away from him or stay far enough away that he couldn't touch me or anything. The owner of the company showed up and was doing something to try to help me. I smelled incense and realized that the owner of the company had lit this incense because it was in some way supposed to help me or keep John away from me. The owner of the company told me that he loved me. That made me very happy. I don't know that I said the same to him. The next thing that I remember is that it seemed as though there was a flood. It was as though you were looking at an ocean where you couldn't see beyond the horizon. There was a long boat. It was not a good thing. John threatened or in danger. He said, Oh. What the heck. I'm going to go ahead and get on that huge penis-shaped boat.","1MKA, 1FKA, 2FSC, 1FSA","AP D, CO D, SD D"

21064,melvin,Melvin (Melora's husband),063,1962,2062-10-22,M,Y,"The dream involved my being in an ocean liner, and there was somebody with me, but I can't remember who or how old they were or what sex or anything. It seems that all the crew was gone from this ocean liner, which was anchored right off the shore of a small tropical island. I wanted to be able to operate this ocean liner because I didn't know how. One thing in particular I remember about it was that the ocean liner was floating very high out of the water, such that the door that you went in and out of in this thing was 15 or 20 ft. above the surface of the water, and there were waves of changing how high this ship floated above the water. But I didn't know how to operate it. Well, along on the horizon I saw a ship coming in and it was an aircraft carrier, a Untied States aircraft carrier, and it came right up to us with its bow coming right to the door. And its deck was just as high as our door was and it came up flush against the door so that one could just stroll off onto its deck. But I and a companion walked out across the deck, or rather we stepped out onto the deck, and then we had some sort of a car. It was an unusual car. I sort of thought it was a car designed by another nation or something like that. We should attract a lot of attention from the American sailors here. We drove over the deck and nothing happened. Then I had a sort of fantasy that we wanted to attract their attention somehow. So I had this fantasy about shooting a rocket from the car up ahead of us as if we were attacking them, but this didn't produce any results. Then we got up to where everybody was and we ran around and no one was paying any attention to us. It seemed very strange to us. We were walking around inside the aircraft carrier and in the passageway we found a couple of officers talking. We forcibly stopped them and told them, ""Look, we have an ocean liner here with no crew and we don't know how to work it."" We want to do something with it, and weren't they even interested? And they didn't seem to be interested. So we went on back to the ocean liner. When we got back where the ocean liner was, it wasn't there any more. So we thought at first that they had given us some help and that they had moved it probably around into the river flowing out from this island which we couldn't see from where we were because there was a great big hotel blocking our view on the shore. There was a car there, though, sort of like a Ford Falcon or a Nash Rambler or something, and it was about 20 feet up in the air; no, more like about 10 feet up in the air on some stilt-like affair. So we climbed up into the car. I think my companion may have been my wife now, but I'm not sure, and pressed the mechanism that let these stilts back into the car, drove off over around the back of the hotel. But the ocean liner wasn't there, and the river kind of turned into a road that we were driving down which led into a parking lot. We turned around and came back to the hotel, and we were careful in turning around in the parking lot, not to go beyond a certain boundary because most of the island was inhabited by a sort of foreign creature which killed any man that went onto it. This part seems to have been inspired by a science fiction story I read last night. Anyway, we drove back to the hotel and started going down some stairs, and at the bottom was a tiger. We started going back up the stairs and there was a little switch built in the wall. We knew that when we threw this switch, at a certain point the tiger would not be allowed to come above that point and where we stopped him on the stairs would determine how he and all future tigers acted. The tiger was already up high enough when we saw this such that he would be bloodthirsty and try and take over from man. So I turned around and put my foot on his head and shoved him back down the stairs, half a dozen steps or so. Then threw the switch, which stopped him at a level where he would not attack me, but was also at a level where the tiger had to have some sort of duties to perform. So I finally figured out that we would train him to catch mice cause that sort of fitted in with his natural duties. And we did so. I don't know how. We just told him to catch mice or something like that. That was about the end of the dream.","1ISA, 2MOA, 2MOA, 2MOA",

There was a lot of confusion surrounding the event: first, I had forgotten my dress but had no way of getting home to retrieve it; My mother was be really unhelpful; Jessica was trying to call me, but my phone wouldn't work, and the whole time I am just trying to get my dress. I somehow managed to shower and get ready, and even timed my arrival at the rink properly so that I was neither too early, nor too late. I soon realized, however, that I had put no eye makeup on, so I scrambled through my bag looking for mascara and eyeliner. I ran to the bathroom. In my dream, I thought I looked great in my shiny silver dress and strappy high heels, even though I would probably wear neither of those items in real life. So I finished applying eye makeup and tried to find Aaron. I had been looking forward to gala for a while because I wanted to be with him. On the bleachers of the rink was every guy from my high school. But I was frustrated because I only wanted to see Aaron, but instead I could only see every guy from high school. I kept hoping he would just find me and pull me away. And even as I started waking up, I tried to stay asleep to see if I would ever find Aaron, but I never did. It was almost as if I knew my conscious self couldn't see him, so I wanted my unconscious side to compensate for the absence.","1FKA, 1MKA, 1FKA, 2MKA",AN D

I notice that no matter where we place it, it's not quite right on the bottom side. I try adjusting my position to see if it makes a difference. Someone says I have excellent spatial perception. I am surprised because I don't, usually. I decide this is a boring class and wander around noticing other classes. I pass the animal biology classes and don't like them. I find myself in the film media classes, big classes lots of students, cute instructors. I am interested. I decide I'll get into one of those. Now I want to go home, but I can't find an exit door that works. Two men students follow me upstairs and try to open conversation. I ask them how to get out. They take me back downstairs, which is hard in my manual wheelchair. They are impressed with me and say they have a room I could rent in their boarding house. I say, ""I've already got one, thanks."" I finally get out and head home. A piano tuner is tuning the old square like piano I had found in the basement for me and it has been moved up to the living room. The landlady gives me and my male friend a lecture about being always late for meals and we will get cold meals if we keep this up. I look outside and see my small brother, maybe 5 years old, wandering away toward the big lake. I am concerned and run after him to retrieve him. I see him get into a rowboat with several other boys and head out for deep water. I tell my younger sister she must go back and tell my father and get help. She cries that she is afraid she will lose her way and not know the turns. I grab her by the shoulders and say with confidence, ""You are a smart girl. You will know the right way."" She goes. I run across the rice paddy-like area, then over the beach sand and then into the water. Just then I see the small plastic rowboat and yank my brother out of it after some confusion about which one was my brother. I give him what for, lecturing him at how surprised I was that he would not heed our dead mother's words about always being honest. Other people come to retrieve their little boys and I learn they had been going around begging for money and collecting some. I am handed some plastic spoons as his share of the take. I want to return it to the rightful owners, but have no way to do so so. I walk my brother back toward home, continuing to say I am so surprised at him.

24392,pegasus,Pegasus: a factory worker,0759,1949-1964,2061-12-24,M,A,"We were walking along a street, then all at once we ran. There was a big, high telephone post falling or looked like falling. When we got out of the way, we looked at the post and it was long and way higher. It was tied to the top with long ropes. The post men were setting it into a hole and had to hope those ropes tied to the top of the post because it was such a long post. It must have been about 20 ft. long. Charlie Charvat was with me when we ran from under the post. We sat on someone's back porch and were looking at the sky, which was getting ready for a storm. I heard the young fellow in the house accusing us as suspects of a murder. He came out later and had a gun in his hand. He got Charlie, then came at me, pointing the gun at me. I raised my hands and he accused us of murdering Arendas. I said, ""We didn't kill no one. You can take us to the police and they will let us free because we are innocent."" He was puzzled and then was deciding to take us somewhere with his friend and beat us up. I said, ""Oh no, you're not going to do that. You take us to the police and we will be freed."" While he was thinking of what to do, I picked up the gun he threw away and I forced him to take off the handcuffs. He did and we went to his basement and got in our car and we were blocked by him and his friends. I didn't want to run over them and that convinced him we were innocent. We were outside talking as friends. A half dollar fell out of my pocket and rolled near two men who were sitting. They both saw the half dollar when it stopped rolling and were oozing up to it backwards to pick it up, but I picked it up and we watched the two reach to pick it up and there was no money there, to their surprise. They looked and it was gone. I came to a place where there were men sitting at a gambling table. Jack Lasko was one and he had 6 sixes that was high and winner of $600, but the man said something, he didn't want him to win now because he would be pinched for a gambling charge. I saw about 4 sevens and 4 fives that others had. I counted the 6 sixes. My dad and I were climbing up on top of a shanty. He said, ""Let's see how high you can kick,"" so I had my foot on the top and I kicked up and said, ""Look how high I can kick."" We then got on the top and sat there. I met Rose Lasko. I started to love her up. I was kissing her and feeling her up at the same time. Carter was doing exercise on the floor. When he was through, he got hold of Bernice's gown or what she was sitting on and he pulled it from under her. She fell back on her back and her vagina was exposed. She had no hair on or around it.

I told him that I thought it was and pointed out on the one he was working on that I could see where he had cleaned and where he hadn't. He was working on the upstairs bathroom. I told him he needed to step out for a minute because I needed to use it. After I closed the door I realized the toilet was about to overflow. I flushed it several times and was playing with the mechanisms in the tank trying to get it fixed. I didn't want to use the plunger but was about to tell Matthew that he needed to get the plunger and fix it. Just at that time, some people came in and I realized they had been working in that bathroom. It was apartment maintenance men. I didn't even know they had been in there and done anything. I hadn't called them to do anything. They replaced the upstairs toilet with an older toilet that was all cracked around the rim and nasty looking. Where it was cracked, there were several colors light blue and yellow and I don't remember what other colors. They had also replaced the sink and counter fixture with this big ugly unit that had two trashcans built in, the kind you might see in some public bathrooms and it was a maroon color. It was also a double sink but the one sink was fairly small and rectangular in shape and the other one was round and regular size. I didn't like it at all. I questioned them as to why they were doing this when there was nothing wrong with the old fixtures. They didn't give me good answers. I didn't like the work at all. They basically just ignored me. Then a woman came in while they were here. She was from the apartment office and she said her name was Lao. I told her that as soon as these men left I would be calling her to talk to her about this. They gave me a form to sign and fill out. On several places on the form, I made it very clear that I did not like the work that they had done. That I had not requested it. That it was poor quality. One of them at one point said this isn't going to be good while he was watching me fill out the form. I just ignored him and kept writing. It wasn't the normal form that I fill out and sign when I have work done here. Then they pointed out a place for me to write some extensive comments. I wanted to get one of my own pens because the pen they gave me wasn't working well at all. I guess I thought. I don't know if I was actually talking to someone on the phone or if I was just thinking. When I called the apartment complex, I told them that I don't have a problem with John D or any of the men that normally work for him at all. They almost always do an excellent job. However, I was not pleased with this at all. As someone who has lived here almost four years, I think this is inappropriate to come in and have something like this done without my knowledge or consent.

26440,sally,Sally: a forester,114,1983-2009,1996-11-01,F,Y,"I was in Utah.  I was working at Lynn's on my computer, on a lot of cases.  It seemed like at the motel (Thompson Springs), it had that old feeling (coal smell, old metal furniture, poor lighting, a little cold), but it looked different.  Lynn was in and out while I worked, some other people occasionally too.  I was feeling okay about work and Lynn.  Then I went out.  I was out for a while, and while away, I somehow knew that things had gone bad with Lynn, that he had gotten into one of his moods/phases/tirades, out to get me.  He was pissed at me.  I got worried about the stuff I had left there at Lynn's.  I drove up to a building.  I was driving someone else's truck or van, it was older and bigger than mine, dirty, unorganized, maybe Lynn's Suburban or truck.  Lynn was driving my truck.  This building reminded me of the Thompson motel, it was about ten rooms lined up each with a door out front and a sidewalk.  But it was a dormitory or frat house of a college.  There was something in front of the rooms, a swimming pool or cars or a fenced area, not just the parking lot.    Some young men were making a banner for the roof or writing words up on the roof across all the middle rooms.  I realized it was the last day of school or after the last day, and everyone was moving out, and this was some kind of celebratory or goodbye college banner.  I read it in the dream;  I can't remember what it said now, but I remember it was kind of funny.  I went in two of the rooms.  I was looking for my things, my purse mainly.  Because when I realized that Lynn was on one of his tirades against me, I also realized that he had my truck, and the keys to my truck were in my purse, and he had access to my purse since I had left it at the motel.  I was worried he would take my purse, and I was worried about getting my truck back.  The rooms, as I peeked in, were disheveled, dirty, stuff left everywhere, sheets, cups and trash, stuff like that, half-broken furniture.  It looked pretty dilapidated.  I picked up a bag or box from one of the rooms, without even looking into it, just hoping my stuff was in there.  I got to the van I was driving.  I remember wanting my own truck back as I got into that old van.  But an older witchy woman stopped me and asked why I was taking that bag or box.  I said oh, I left my purse here, I thought it might be in this bag.  I started pulling things out of the bag and it was a white paper on top, like a folded map, and below that about four blankets, old yellow colored.  So my purse was not in there.  I was upset.  I went back to where I had been working at Lynn's.  I sat down at the desk and started working again.  But something was different.  The machine I was now working on didn't seem the same, it was an older model, it didn't do the things the former one could do, like it had no memory.  This one just looked like a mere typewriter, not a computer, and an old crummy typewriter at that.  It had one of those old typewriter balls that spins around for the letters.  I got scared about all the work I had done before:  was it saved, or had Lynn taken it?  (At this point it seemed even the former computer I had been working on was also a loaner from Lynn, or in any case, not mine anymore.  So it wasn't like he took MY computer, at this point, more like he had substituted an older one in place of the earlier one, thinking maybe I wouldn't notice.)  I started looking for the work I had done previously, was it saved here?  Just then Lynn and Leah sat down on either side of me.  They were both acting cruel and controlling, scheming, closing in on me.  Leah was working for Lynn, doing what he said.  I questioned Lynn, and it came out that he had taken all of my work, all the casework I had already completed, on purpose.  He had my files on disk.  All of my work, it was gone, and he wasn't going to tell me where it was.  He said something about taking it because of any possible things in there about him.  I was really mad, frustrated, upset at him.  I realized this was worse than him taking my truck or purse, my earlier fears had not even been as terrible as what he really did here.  Also either this night or the night before I dreamed I was kissing and making out with Erik.  We were a couple, in love, happy, together, partners.  I really enjoyed kissing him and could see his face, lips and body close to me.  There was a feeling that he was mine.","1FKA, 2JSA, 1MSA","AP D, AN 1MKA, AP D"

There is a small pile of vitamins and herbal supplements spread out on the sofa cushion next to me. I am sorting them and putting them each back into their appropriate bottle. Gary S is sitting in an armchair to my right. We are talking about reconnecting after so many years. He is saying something about his age and that he is physically not able to have intercourse anymore. I glanced at him, just from the corner of my eyes and had a half-smile on my face. I was thinking that it didn't have to be that way because I know someone older than him who doesn't have that problem and he doesn't take drugs to help him with that. He then sarcastically says that at least that's the latest he knows about men his age. I immediately think about the familiar sarcastic tone in his voice, knowing that it's not meant to be mean or ugly or anything like that, but that it is very typical for him. Now it's more like I'm daydreaming in the dream about him and wondering what it would be like to reconnect with him. I realize that he is thinking the same thing at the same time. I think to myself that it doesn't do either one of us any good if neither of us is willing to make the first move. Now I'm back at the house and he is talking about someone. I've not heard the name before and I think he is talking about a place because it's unusual and it never would have occurred to me that it was someone's first name. There are 2 or 3 other women in the house in the adjoining room. A young woman enters that room from outdoors. She is talking to the other women while she is leafing through her mail. Gary S and I go into that room. He introduces me to the young woman who just came in. It is his daughter, but not his waking life daughter. She doesn't seem very pleased to see me or meet me. I suppose she is suspicious of my relationship to her dad. He tells her my name when he introduces us but not how he knows me. I wonder if he has told her about me sometime in the past, but that would surprise me if he had. She is almost cold to me. She nods and continues looking through her mail. Then she leaves.

I turned and looked at a white marble lion--astounded that its smallest and thinnest parts did not crumble and hit me. I got up to tell someone of my good luck. Suddenly the room was filled with a charity sale, all the garage-sale junk you ever saw there in that room, on tables. People walked around the column on the floor in unconcern. I saw a red-haired guard with freckles who seemed friendly. I walked up to tell of my cleverness that saved my life. He didn't understand English very well, saying he was Ukrainian. And talked mostly in Ukrainian to me, with an English word here and there. So I joined the people looking at the stuff for sale. I looked at Street & Smith pulp westerns, some bound, some loose issues. Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes in volume sets, one in a large bread wrapper, each book like a slice, others in plastic one beside another, as people carry credit cards.

Then she painted what would have been the open space sky blue. She painted the mailbox yellow, the grass etc. green. I think there were also flowers. After everyone had finished the instructors were talking about people's work. They especially liked this woman's ability. She had also painted a picture of herself. Garnet P was just there as a representative of the paint company. They were also looking at two large collages that the group had made. Some of it was done with the tubes of glitter paint like I use.

I was walking around trying to find my shoes. I found them but in doing so stepped in some black paint. Then, I accidentally stepped on a piece of paper that appeared to be painted solid yellow. I was worried that I had ruined someone's painting. Then I noticed several other similar pieces, of different colors, that others had stepped on too, so I didn't worry about it anymore. I pointed to the stain on my shoe to Garnet P and asked her how to get the rest of the paint out. She hushed me and said just a minute. I made my way to the racquetball courts. I looked in each door trying to find the one that Matthew and the Y employee were in. When I found it, I went in just as they were going out a side door. There was another man sitting in there and I asked him and he pointed that they had just gone out that side door. I was aggravated.","1MKA, 1MKA, 2ISA, 2IOA, 1FKA",AP D

The turtle also went face on the ground and the alligator chased him, then jumped on the turtle's back.

I go along with her mood, but question how we can have sex now when we are in the company of others. She laughs and suggests that I try and find out -- and leads me out of the room and into a hallway where there are no people. Then she comes to me, we embrace and kiss. It is a long, passionate kiss.

I was dressed in a black, floor-length gown that was just over one shoulder. It had a slit up the side and kind of along the side of the torso as well. Then it had little rhinestones on the part that goes up the shoulder of the bodice. They were both scheduled for the same night. There was also something else going on that night. I don't remember now what. I made the one for the apartment community and then I rushed to the church and I was too late for that one. Then I went back to the apartment community for some other things. They had some gifts for us. There was some discussion about lease renewal. Part of the dream it was daylight. It seemed that I was at the condo instead of the apartment community. I was working in the yard and there was this big piece of black something that was rolled up and someone was digging up part of the yard and unrolling it and was going to bury it there. That isn't what it was intended to be used for and I thought that was odd that it was how they were using it. I went back to the church and my car wouldn't start. I somehow moved it anyway. It was as though I picked it up and moved it and sat it alongside, by the rectory. There were three cars parked there. I kind of picked mine up and moved it to sit alongside those three, facing the same direction. Now it was dark and I went up to the back door and it was very rustic looking. Like the door and the walls almost blended together. There was no window or anything in the door. I rang the doorbell and there was a little window above the door where I could see if someone was coming or not. So I was kind of watching and it was like 9:00 and I felt bad that I was bothering them so late at night but I didn't know what else to do since my car wouldn't start. I was just going to ask someone if they could give me a jump. And Beth came to the door. She was wearing her pajamas. Of course she said she would be right out to help. I stepped inside the door while she went and got jumper cables and she came back kind of rushing. I apologized again for bothering her so late at night and I told her that I did know how to use the jumper cables. Then there were 3-4 steps coming out of the rectory. As we were coming down the steps I was explaining that I was in the fashion show there and that I was also supposed to be in a fashion show at the apartment community and had just too many things going on that night and I was rushing around and now my car wouldn't stop and I was just very apologetic.","2JSA, 1ISA, 1FKA",SD D

I needed to find a place to live and so this man gave me an apartment in his building. He was the landlord. But in exchange I had to be with these different men and I had to get pregnant and have a baby. At first I didn't seem to mind it but I think after the baby was born he would carry us upstairs several floors to his apartment and then he would throw us down a space between the flights of steps. There was space in-between the flights of steps that just went straight down to the bottom floor. You could see all the way down from the top floor to the bottom. He would knock us down in this space to kill the baby, even though he wanted me to get pregnant and have these babies for him. I was trying to escape. My father, who is in a band, was going to take me in. I went to this apartment with my father and his band and it turns out that they wanted the same thing from me, only with them. It started out that he asked specifically who I was supposed to be with. It just wasn't working but I didn't know why. I asked my mother if she thought it would be okay if I had sex with one of the band members instead. She talked to my father and he said it would be okay. [unknown] They started playing music. I was supposed to start being romantic and having sex with this man. I went up to the one band member that I was attracted to and I started flirting with him. He was the keyboardist. He quit playing and sat there and then we went out to a car. My father followed us. He opened the car door and was very angry. But he was angry because this band member was apparently impotent. I think my mother must have intervened and calmed him down and asked him to let me try anyway. There was all of this fine powdery snow inside the car, waist high to the band member that was sitting in the driver seat. So my father used his hand and was brushing the snow out of the car and then agreed to let me try and it worked. I think my father was doing the same thing as the other man. He was trying to kill either the band member or the baby afterwards by throwing them down the same space between the flights of steps. I think either I or someone else ended up throwing him down the space in-between the steps.","1MSA, 2MSA, 1FKA, 1MKA, 1MKA","AN 1MKA, AN 1MKA"

21037,melvin,Melvin (Melora's husband),036,1962,2062-07-19,M,Y,"I was a prisoner in some sort of fortress or castle. I don't know where or when it was. In some ways things were rather primitive and in some ways they were rather modern. The person who held me prisoner was sort of a war lord of this castle. There was someone else in my cell with me, a friend of mine, but I don't know who he was or what he looked like or anything. I can't recall that. We were seeking some way to escape and we knew we'd need help from the people who lived outside the castle. There were two groups of these people. One was a bunch of peasants who lived around and farmed, I guess. The other was a group of nomads, sort of Arabs, who lived in a little fortress of their own up on the next hill. But each of these groups was afraid of the war lord and his powers because of the fighting he had had. In our cell there was a bucket full of bottles of various kinds of pills. I found that some of these pills were tranquilizers and some were stimulants. So I conceived the idea that I could give the Arabs and the peasants stimulants and slip tranquilizers to the fighting men of the war lord and be able to defeat them about that way. While I thought of this scheme, somebody came around looking around for a particular kind of medicine, some agent of the war lord, and I went to the bucket and got what he wanted for him so he wouldn't notice the stimulants and tranquilizers in there. In the next part of the dream that I recall we, my friend and I in the cell, seem to have persuaded the peasants and the Arabs to fight against the war lord. We were on top of a cliff outside of the castle, not exactly a cliff, but a very steep hill made up of loose dirt, and we had gotten a lot of stones together at the top to hurl down on the war lord's armies when they come. I guess the stimulants and the tranquilizers had been distributed. The war lord's armies get into sight and some of them get below the cliff and we start to hurl rocks down on them, everything from large rocks to hands full of gravel. At one point I'm part way down the face of the hill throwing rocks and stuff down when I start slipping because the dirt is so loose.  I call for someone to toss me a rope down so I can get back up. I believe somebody does throw a rope or perhaps I only imagine it in my dream, but I don't quite catch it, so I slide on down to the bottom of the hill. Well, at this point, I imagine in the dream that I should have to fight to avoid being taken prisoner by the war lord's armies. So in my imagination I get a sword and cut down thru the war lord's armies. So in my imagination I get a sword and cut down thru the war lord's men and escape back up the cliff, but I don't exactly see these men. I see sort of a diagram that's got a bunch of points on it connected by a line. It reminds me of graphs I've been drawing lately for my thesis. So I cut out two of these points and this represents the fact that I've cut out two men in the army and then I climb back up the cliff at a different point where it's not quite so steep. We continue throwing rocks down, but the enemy army does get up to the top of the cliff at one point and here's where the Arabs come in. They race back and forth along the top of the cliff pushing off the enemy army in waves as they come up each time the Arabs race back and forth along the edge. I don't exactly see the Arabs racing on horses along the edge of the cliff. What I see in my dream is bookcases and piles of books along the edge of the cliff and I and some others are walking along pushing off books off the edge of the cliff. Some of my own books from my office are there. The enemy is trying to push these down, but they're big, heavy books and they don't push over easily. I think in the dream that the war lord's men will be surprised because they didn't think that we had such heavy books. Finally, the war lord's army is defeated. We apparently dropped stones on enough of them and pushed enough of them over so that most of his power is broken and we've won the battle. At this point I rejoin my comrade from the cell who was fighting on the other side of the hill where the peasants were. He shows me what he has captured. It seems that there was a shack alongside of the cliff and it was very tall and practically came up to where he was. Some of the war lord's men had gone in there to try and get up the cliff and it was a natural trap for them because they threw stones, oh, it must have been an open window or the upper part of the roof or something. I can't recall clearly now, but either they left a boat in there or they left a pile of weapons in there or something like that. So my friend had captured all of them now, all of these weapons or the boat or whatever it was. I believe there was a lake next to the shack so a boat would be appropriate. Then we were inside somewhere and I wanted to make a phone call. At this point I realized in the dream that I was an agent from earth and that this was another planet. I had accomplished a mission and I had to call in and report. So I picked up on old telephone and gave the operator the number. Something like 5217 or 5214, something like that, and told her to crank her ringer if she had to crank her ringer to get it. I thought about how this would actually put me in touch with a relay station, which via radio or something like that, would enable me to contact my superiors back on earth. I thought how cleverly disguised our relay station was so that even when the operator rang it would sound like an old-fashioned wheezy telephone bell.","1MSA, 1MSA, 2MEA, 2MSA, 1MSA, 1MOA",AP 1MKA

357,alta,Alta: a detailed dreamer,355,1985-1997,1991-12-15,F,A,"I've just gotten married to this wonderful guy who lives in a (little?) suburban house (a sort of 50's-VA-ranch-style). He's got light brown hair, tallish, handsome, friendly, and very sweet. I've only just moved in and still feel very tentative, disoriented. The house has this one big room that he uses as a club on Saturday nights, all the young people come and dance. [We're talking about 20-35 really, age-wise.] We've been getting everything ready, actually he's been running around doing things and I've pitched in where I could. There's also a friend of his - a girl, old friend from school or the neighborhood - helping out, she's very nice, helped me feel welcome. Now people are arriving, quite a lot of them, and there's a lot to do, taking their coats, getting drinks, etc.At some point I've gone to the bathroom, and the door latch wouldn't catch, so I just have to hope nobody walks in. It's a long bathroom with some sort of partition in it, and a worktable. The girlfriend is sitting at it, and my husband apparently starts to come in, because she starts talking to him rather loudly, in such a way as to keep him outside the room, for my benefit. I'm not enjoying all this bustle a lot, and I go off into another part of the house to get away for a while. It's all very new, this place, this town, living with this man, being married - I haven't know him long, we just fell for each other like a ton of bricks and I wanted to be with him so much I'd do anything. Now I'm wondering if I can get used to it, if I fit in. Do I even want to be married? I go across the street and visit with some older neighbors, still feeling confused. After a bit, people start pouring out of the house - first a clump, then a clump, then a stream. They seem to be excited about something, all talking and hurrying. I can't see or hear what's going on so I go out front, and I hear bits of sentences, about fire, and my husband's name. Some of them see me and stop talking, but I also hear, ""(he's) dead"" [I don't know his name] a time or two. I'm dumbfounded. I look at the house, expecting to see flames burst out of the windows, but all there is, is a big plume of white smoke coming from one area of the house. Thoughts go through my head about how ironic it is to be only just married and now not be again, will everything just go back to normal? But I have to know what's happened - I rush into the house, stumbling through rooms, past overturned furniture, till I come to where he is, and he's alive - there are firemen around, they've got the fire out and a lot of things are wet, including my husband. He looks exhausted, and he's very cold, he's done something heroic that saved the day but now he's all wet and suffering somewhat from shock. The girlfriend has a trench coat over his shoulders that she's trying to keep around him, but it's wet too. When I see him I scream and rush to him - suddenly my doubts are all gone, I know I want to be with him whatever it takes, I love him so much. I pull the coat off of him [and either he's naked, or I get his other clothes off him] and hold him tight, wrapping myself around him tight to give him my body heat. He says something about the fire, how apparently it burned up this little wooden thing he'd bought for me, how ironic that was - we'd been talking about it earlier, we'd seen it in a shop or at a craft fair and I'd loved it - a little box of 2 exotic woods, how unusual it was, and it cost $275. That's very expensive, and of course we said we couldn't afford it, but he'd gotten it for me anyway on the sly. I look around to see what happened to it, but I don't spot it, even though I see some other little nice wood things.","1MKA, 2JSA, 1FKA, 1MKA, 2JKA","CO D, CO D"

And we went to a hotel, not to stay, we were doing something else there.  Something happened before we went to the hotel, or the motel, that prompted it, that made me need to do something at the motel.  So I went there with my oldest sister and this guy, and he looked kind of like Rick C (short-term housemate in Moab), but it was a new love, like Mike.  And I started getting really sick of them, I started not wanting to be around the guy.  It just wasn't right, it wasn't feeling matched up.  And then my oldest sister started being rude to me, she'd be snotty rude, and so when I got the chance I left them, and ditched them, went my own way.  I didn't tell them where I was going, I just ditched them.  And I went on these stairs, and so I was looking at my feet on the stairs, at that moment, going up the stairs.  And then I got myself into the end of the hallway stairwell, so that I was really hidden and I could get away from them, and they'd never find me, for a long time.  The motel was about five or six stories high and I was going to walk all the way up to the top.  So I was walking up this stairwell.  It was kind of an old motel, it wasn't all run down and gross, but it wasn't new or anything.  It had kind of a big feeling but it was kind of run down.  And so the stairs were concrete or metal, concrete, yeah concrete.  I got to a landing up near the top, near where they put stuff that's been . . . like a lost and found.  Or just, they put stuff that's been left there, forgotten.  [I did go Wednesday to Thompson, and all the stuff I left in my cabin in Castle Valley was in that little wood house next to Lynn's motel.  it was really weird to see my stuff, my bath powder, lotion, very feminine stuff, my cactus.  It's been sitting in there over the WHOLE WINTER.]  Anyway, I came to this landing, and there was stuff on a table, like an old table, it was all just sort of left there.  Part of it was employee stuff, for the motel.  Part of it was just stuff that had been left there.  And there were letters from Lynn, on the table.  Some of them were like the letters that he wrote about the oil field, to Spear and the sheriffs, those really rant and rave, you done me wrong and you'll pay, kind of letters.  And some of them had sweet things about me in them.  I mean, my name was in them, and I was reading them - realizing that information about me and my name, was out here, for anyone to see, it had been sitting out in this motel, and anybody could read about it.  It made me feel weird, sad, about the broken dreams.  Because there were sweet things in those letters.  And it was even more clear to me, or it is now, that it's not black and white, it never will be, I can't . . . .  I would love to be able to say he's an asshole, I'm glad I'm gone.  But it's not that black and white, and it never will be.  Then there were also these horrible letters on the table.  The lighting in this stairwell was kind of, it was like light from a high window coming through frosted glass.  Kind of like morning light.

Right now I don't know whether or not I'll just disappear when we get there, or offer some excuse why I'm leaving the group (like I phone home and they tell me I'm needed), or maybe I'd even like to stay and see. But I've got to get home. I think I'd prefer to call somebody to come get me because using the buses means waiting a long time, then going downtown to transfer. Or I could walk. A long haul, but maybe I could get to one of my own bus lines. I'm at the entrance to the Faire, or perhaps another, but I want to go there anyway. I'd been planning to go later after going home and changing clothes, but I find myself here anyway. (I'm not sure how - is this where the bus was? Or where the bus stopped? [Or another dream?]) I'm wearing shorts and have a big shoulder-strap bag and a parcel or 2nd bag with me, not heavy but awkward to carry and I have no place to leave it. I'm hesitating, weighing the possibilities of not going in and seeing it now, when I'm already here, and being burdened with these things and not free to enjoy myself. The entrance is a kind of big tunnel, short, call it more like an underpass - you arrive at it from a residential street (nice place too); on somebody's lawn, quite large, one of those rises off the street but not too high. There are people outside, just hanging around talking, and you can see the Faire through the tunnel. I think I've made up my mind to go ahead and take advantage while I'm here but I get halfway in and decide this is not practical and I can wait long enough to go get more comfortable. I'm fighting a fear that it'll go away if I leave now. I can picture myself inside, looking up at a display (like the earring lady's) - everything looks more like a carnival. I'm in a very large room - gym-size - in an institution, perhaps - and there are lots of people (all more or less my age) who, I think, have to do with LT. There are bathroom-stalls set up inside the room in long rows and it may be morning and everybody has bathroom-stuff to do. Lots of movement. I'm looking for a free stall because I have to use the toilet, and I find one at the end of a row. These have 2 doors, one each side. The other door is open, and there's another girl in here. (These are 2-person stalls, you see: they have sinks and mirrors and so forth, too, actually quite nice), and I ask her to shut the other door. Which she does. That's all.","2JSA, 1MSA, 2JSA",

There were no ""no picnic"" signs. We decided to live at the picnic. There was a teeny little trailer for me. Very teeny and very, very small on the inside. There were dancers, enough to make a tribe. Mess, clothes, used towels scattered around and NO BATH MATTS! So I went to the store where they had lots of bathmats. Pastel colors I didn't want. It was small and square and almost black. Then I saw the one I wanted. It was like a shammy with Velcro all around the sides. There was a history pageant. A trip back to the 1700's. People were walking across a stage. People walked across the stage--a line of them--they were not used to wearing clothes like that, and looked more like a herd of cows than people. I stuck out my feet to look at my silver slippers. They were beautiful. I went to show that I knew how people walked then--wearing all those hoop skirts and everything. The girls in the pageant were vain. With the centuries old, and dresses they wore in the latest styles. Then I went to Linda's store. A guy who was Linda's partner had hurt his back. He had called a special cab to come in the middle of the historical pageant and pick him up. The historical pageant had to start early because it was mostly old people in the audience and they were falling asleep. When I left Linda's 2 people were there. A man and a woman. I knew but didn't know. A different guy connected??? There was a man, a politician, wearing a suit standing in the ocean in his shoes. Waves came over and he would run.

I see water waves spraying up among the rocky shapes off in the distance. There are people on the beach and it's somewhat crowded. It's also kind of muddy. I need to leave there, perhaps some eruption or danger is possible. A man and myself (who is sort of Justin and Lucy) needs to get away and are being held back somehow (a bad guy). They are finally permitted logs (sawed off segments, maybe four or five of them stacked). They go to the river and throw them in and ride them like a horse, their feet, with shoes on, underwater (dragging their feet). They float down this huge, wide green river, feeling pretty clever at their use of the logs, rather than being burdened by carrying them. The woman also decides to keep near the shoreline. In case she falls off, she'll be able to swim in. But there are rocks and shallows, so they have to go out some distance to get around that. This is all working out fairly well, until the river changes. There are level changes (like giant steps or locks) (like in Panama Canal). They will have to get out of the river and carry their logs until they get past this part. There's something about a bus ride either taken or missed. Then she sees the river up ahead. It is rushing white water and big falls and rapids! They both agree it will no longer be OK to go down the river. So they walk. Now there is some bad guy. I think he is the owner of a shyster carnival set up. He says we have to shoot at a target to see our sharpshooting skills. Maybe we'll win (our freedom?). He points to a (see drawing) circle with a hole in it of green stone that is on a wall and moving in the breeze. He grins. I look again and see it's a (see drawing) pyramid-shaped stone and therefore hasn't a hole in it for the arrow to hit. I say, ""No thanks. That's too hard. Not fair. I'll shoot at the dolly in the water-filled case."" I see a case like a china cabinet of Grandma Agnes'. It is filled with water and in it is a fat dolly. The guy agrees/laughing. He tells the dolly to get out. She goes out the back door and as she's shutting the door, her ""fat suit"" padding gets caught in the door. At the breasts, three or four breasts of the padding is all caught in the door. Now the pad floats off the dolly and floats in the water. The real dolly comes in, her porcelain face old-fashioned and sweet. She has ringlets. She stands at the back of the case waiting for me to attempt to shoot her. Now a padded sheet (like over a piano) is all over the case so I can't see where the dolly is. The guy asks, ""Want to get up closer?"" It's like he's being generous, but he's really not. I smile with confidence and say, ""No thanks."" I aim my bow and arrow sort of at a cloth toy mouse and shoot. My tiny arrow looks like it's missed because it hit at the front of the case.

I figured out a way to do it. It does sound pretty good, even now. What you would do is get a house with a big basement and a big hot furnace, maybe one of these coal-burning types, and you'd fix your still somehow so it would be right close to this furnace. You could fix something coming out from the furnace that would supply heat to your still so that you could distill your liquor. The whole thing was supposed to be mounted on wheels so if anybody did come snooping around, you could just, quick, shove the whole thing off into a closet somewhere so they wouldn't find it. We were talking about distilling wine, making wine, and we were wondering if you would distill it in any way and sort of reading a recipe or being read a recipe by somebody, and at the same time seeing this operation being carried on. The scene sort of took place in front of this large white farmhouse, somewhere out in the country. Finally we were there and this wine bit sort of faded into the background. These people were just moving into this house, this older couple and sort of a foreign couple. I guess they were in their middle 30's or something. They seemed to be somebody we knew, but I don't know who they could have been, really nobody that I can place. So we were going thru the house. I think they were showing us the house or something, and it was fairly nice, large rooms and attractive. In the kitchen, the kitchen was in two parts and in one part the woman put up a lot of dishes she wasn't going to use and wrapped each one of them in this white shelf paper, which seemed like an awful lot of work, but she had done this, and had shelf paper on the shelves under them too. The next episode in this dream was very vaguely similar to one of the things that would occur in gothic novels because it was concerned with a much oppressed heroine who -- oh, there was somebody sinister. It all took place in this farmhouse which was about as unsinister as it could be, but there was something sinister. I was trying to find the appropriate moment or something to see what was going on and so I had this book I had read in real life in my hand, which had indexed all these events.

My family runs for cover and I run down the sidewalk, trying to get to the border where the Dutch can help me. He (the huge German guard) yells, ""Halt,"" and I run. I pour a cream-based jelly out of a tube into his eyes as my defense. He tries to shoot me. I run. I make it to the intersection and try to cross. A Dutch person comes across and helps me across. The German follows and I nearly empty the tube in his eyes and kick at his groin and trip him. He falls and I yell, ""Get me a gun."" I meant to kill him. The Dutch laughs nervously, surely she doesn't mean to use it. Some wise person says gently, ""Get her the gun. She won't kill, but needs to make the effort of holding him at gunpoint for her dignity.""","2MEA, 1ISA, 1MOA, 1MEA, 1FSA, 1ISA",AP 1MKA
