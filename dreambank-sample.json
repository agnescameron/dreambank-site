Surprisingly he agrees. So I turn up at an address by a river or a canal - it reminds me of Amsterdam.  I'm shown in by a tall guy with dark hair - apparently a guitarist. \"Thom's about but he's not feeling too good\" he said. He shows me out onto a terrace over looking the canal. There's a few chairs and a large tree with one of those circular iron grills around the foot of it. \"Thom's not alright\" says the guitarist lighting a cigarette, dragging and flicking ash onto the ground which is covered in cigarette butts. \"He was diagnosed with a rare form of alzheimers. He may live for years, but he's very depressed about it, and he's decided to go to Switzerland in the new year to commit suicide.\" \"That's terrible\" I say. Back inside I find Thom, unshaven, a bit distracted, having a cup of tea. He's dressed in jeans and a t-shirt and bare feet. He's congenial - even quite enthusiastic about my project. I don't even know what it is myself to be honest, but he seems to buy into it. My suggestion is that it would be collaboration The budget was small, but we'd have the freedom to experiment. He perks up a bit, and I get the impression his trip to Switzerland might be put on hold.",

    "report":"I was at the CAS office. They were on a boat. The wood slats of the boat had gaps, at least the ones higher than water level had gaps between. The gaps were about what you would see in a fence. So I could see between them. Bill C's office was set behind and above Haley N's and mine. Ours were side by side. I had overslept so I got to work late. My hair was very wet and I wasn't dressed. I just had a towel wrapped around me. I was trying to move around very gingerly so I wouldn't drop my towel and so Bill C wouldn't see anything. Haley N had left. I was reaching into something to try to get the key to my office. I did that. There was something, maybe a bathroom stall, in between my office and Bill C's office. I slipped in there to get dressed. There were actually two of them. I used the one to the right because I was afraid if I used the one to the left Bill C would see me getting dressed. I went into his office. He had Valentine decorations up. I was thinking about the fact that he is very good about seasonal decorations put up on a very timely manner. Then I realized it was Jane C that does that. I heard a radio ad playing. I don't remember what it was for. But when I went to the offices on the boat, I went into Haley N's office for something and she had left her radio playing. The same ad was playing. I was wondering if Bill C had heard that ad. It had something to do with us but I don't know if it was one of our ads or a client that had used our services. I actually think it was someone who had hired me to do a dream lecture, but maybe it also had something to do with CAS. I don't know. When I heard it I thought, oh, they haven't called me in awhile. They haven't hired me in a while. There was something about my relationship with Haley N and it being too late for me to make it better. Bill C was kind of fed up. He asked me to say something into a recorder. He said he was so sick of hearing voices - that he had interviewed so many people. I said, interviewed so many people? I don't understand. Why? He said, Because I have to get ready to fire you. I started begging him not to. He started going over results since I had been there. He was pointing out that I hadn't gotten any results. He said my performance was just okay. I said, Well I don't disagree that I haven't gotten results. I don't think it is due to my lack of effort or ability. I have tried everything that I know to try. I have asked you what to do differently. So, I really don't think it is fair that you would let me go because of that. What I didn't point out to him that his on-going change of direction, inability to focus and stay focused on one goal, or reluctance to make decisions were the primary factors that prevented the company from growing last year. I was getting very upset and beginning to cry. He was getting upset and teary. I was just begging him not to let me go.",

Eventually she turned into a beautiful cat or kitten. There are some empty seats on the bus right next to each other, so I want to talk to somebody else and sit with her, I just can't decide who that would be. I want to talk to Sara (who has actually moved away) about something that happened years ago, about which I don't have her side of the story, but I decide it wouldn't be that interesting to talk about it anyway. Suddenly I see Kerry and this alerts me that I'm dreaming. I think, \"Great, I can put this in my dream journal!\" I decide to leave the bus. I call, \"Hey, A.\" and I tell the driver to stop. We get out. So, we're in what I probably think is France. I hug her and remember not wanting to let go. She disappears in my arms. Then, there's a building, possibly a museum. I remember parts of the building labeled \"castle\" for example, and there was also a gift shop. I went into the bathroom. For some reason that I can not fathom, Wayne Dyer was there telling me if I change the sign on the door, I can change where I am when I open the door. He changed it to a medical museum of some sort, and I came out to see an interesting display, although I didn't feel like reading what it was. Then I remember being outside, and finding out the police are looking for me and two others. I try to get away. I run in every direction (this was very weird, at first in this dream; I can't explain it) and then I just decide to keep running. I run through a fence door that was fortunately open, probably over yet another fence, then into the woods. I hear a guy yelling something in French I now recall sounded something like \"avez moi\" but I take it to mean, \"I'm armed.\" I think this is another guy they're looking for, probably a burglar or murderer or something. I gladly run back to where I was to escape being killed, and by the time I get back outside the building the police are there. Someone tells me I ran a red light, and I'm only getting a fine. Then, I'm in a mall, walking through a book department and by some people I know. Then, I see Kerry #2 and we talk for a while, although I can't remember the conversation. The next thing I know he's having fun with my brother and he and my entire family are in the back seat of a vehicle. (?). Then, I'm in a car, someone gets out and there are a couple books on the passenger's seat: a book that looked like \"The Boy and the Girl\" and another. My CD's were probably in the car too, and I wanted to lock the car to prevent them from being stolen.",

I have trouble walking because my both legs are in one pant leg, like in my mermaid suit. I kind of shuffle, hop along. Then it changes to normal and I walk. I notice a Christmas parade is coming down the street. It's colorful and noisy. We stop to watch it go by. My grandparents (Agnes & Clyde) are there and so is Aunt Esther. The parade is sort of happening through their living room. There are lovely, yellow, lemon-smelling candles. She sure has a lot of candles; her kids must be at that age. Grandma Agnes quarrels about a duck bowl. Rochelle is sitting on a piece of furniture doing a commercial. Half-way through, she runs out of things to day and hops down. I am annoyed at her. She finds a book and asks me to explain it to her. I start teaching about saying yes to a scene and not giving up. She seems to be interested. [BL]",

I decided that the best way to get off of this one-way road or to turn around was to turn there as well. It was a dead-end at a truck stop with a very expansive parking lot. There were quite a few passenger cars there as well. There were rows of something embedded in the pavement, yet protruding from it, in some places. It damage tires but it was very rough to drive over. The best I can describe them as is rows of small squares of raised pavement. I got distracted while I was driving and was lost so I needed to get a map so I could find my way home. I had been presenting a workshop on dreams some place. There was a second small building at this truck stop. It had brown siding and there was an outdoor sitting area with an overhead to protect people from the elements. It was a very small square area with park benches around the perimeter. People were sitting on some of them. There was a map attached to a wooden sign and post, protected by plexiglass. I walked over to the map to figure out where I was and how to get where I needed to go. I was having a conversation with a woman who had two small children with her. Someone else, an older man, also said something to me. As I was looking at this map, some were wanting to look at the map.",

He was standing to my left yet turned slightly so he could easily see my face. He slipped his right arm around the back of my waist. Even as we walked away together he kept his arm around my waist. I don't think I have ever felt so totally and completely comfortable with someone. It was a feeling of total trust, trusting that he would never judge me no matter what.

I pointed the gun at the hawks and it didn't shoot because I pulled the wrong trigger. The hawk started to fly towards me. I aimed the gun at him, but the gun wouldn't go off. The hawk turned into a duck and disappeared behind the old brick schoolhouse of my boyhood days. I was out hunting again in the fields of my boyhood days. I put a lamppost in the center of the street, which is narrow and then I looked how narrow the lanes were on either side of it.",

Then she came down and just touched the ground and went back up. Finally she came down and made a landing on the back end of the plan, which was flat with a lot of prongs or posts on the tail of the plane. There were a lot of children on the plane. When it finally settled down, it tipped and fell on its side. The pilot fell on the ground and was caught by the other children. We looked away and then at the plane again, and there was nothing there. The plane was gone. Ann and I stopped in a bakery. I looked at the delicious hard buns. We waited to get waited on and I looked at a wrap in some kind o f solution in a tub. I got a stick and picked it up and swished it. It was washed clean. Ann was making sandwiches and Judy said Carter was upstairs. I walked up and on the landing I met Carter. He was nude with a towel in his hand, going to the bathroom. When I met him, he was so startled, he stopped dead in his tracks and started to shake from the sudden surprise. Then he put his towel around his body and was nervously moving it around. I could see his penis. It was out as he talked to me.",

    "report":"I was in this old office building. I don't' know exactly how tall it was, maybe about 90 stories, and I was down in the coffee shop of this building. I had a job in this building. It was on the 84th story. This was pretty important. There was one elevator in the building and also a flight of stairs and the elevator was a very strange elevator because it had buttons in it just for a few of the stories, for the 3rd and 9th and the 25th and a couple of others. But everything about that was unmarked. There were no buttons to push to get there and you had to walk this strange contraption to get to the level that you wanted. I don't remember how I got up to this 84th story into this new job that I had, but I got up there somehow. I guess the job was some sort of secretarial work. I don't remember exactly what I was doing, but towards the end of the day when I wanted to go home, I noticed that there was nobody in the elevator to work it. I asked somebody about it and they said you were supposed to work it yourself. I didn't understand how to work it. I knew I would never work it right to get back down to the ground again. Also it took a fairly long time for this elevator. It was an old rickety thing to get up all the way to the top and back again, all the way down and back. So I walked around for a while and found this janitor and I asked him if he could run the elevator for me. We had quite a discussion about it, and he told me how to work it, and he told me he couldn't work it for me and he couldn't take the time unless there were 25 people going down. He took me to the elevator and showed me how it worked. There was a belt of some sort. If you pulled down on it, you would go down. If you pulled up on it, you would make the elevator go up. But, of course, you had to keep stopping and seeing if you were at the right place because there was no way of telling as there was no indicator inside the elevator. As the elevator shaft was open, you could see all the way down it. The elevator itself was only this wooden platform held up by some ropes. When I tried to step on it, it got smaller and smaller until it was just about 2 or 3 inches across. So I didn't much want to get on the thing. I went into the ladies' room and sat down on a couch and had a cigarette while I was thinking what to do. It was about 4:30. A bunch of people were there waiting for the elevator. I didn't think it was safe to go on it, so I decided that I would go down the stairs and started going down, and almost before I knew it, I was on the ground. It seemed like I had come down maybe about 10 flights and I had found it hard to believe that I was on the ground level. I went out through some doors in the building. It was real new. There was a green one and some parking lots. And across the way a little bit another wing of the building where the mechanics and people who worked in the building lived. It was strange that on this side of the building it seemed to be so new because it seemed  such an ancient building when I first went in it. But at any rate, I was outside the building. Somewhere I had met one of the mechanics who worked in this building. I was very attracted by him, and I had a crush on him. So I went over toward the wing of the building where they lived to see if I could find him. I went inside a big door like a truck entrance. I found myself in this low steamy tunnel that had pipes on the ceiling. The floor was damp and it was very moist and steaming in there. I saw two men, but I was too shy to ask them if they knew this boy. So I turned around and came back. I was going back to the building where it now turned out that I lived, and was going to my apartment where I lived with my aunt. Then this boy came up behind me and put his arm around me. I was very happy to see him. He came on into the apartment with me and he was going to have supper with me. My aunt was already serving the supper. She was an old woman. I don't have an aunt like this. She was about in her 70's, and I could tell she didn't much like the idea of this man being here. But she got a third plate and started serving us. She had pork chops and fried onions and rolls and apples or something like that for our supper, but there wasn't very much of it and I was sort of sorry that he had come for supper because there really wasn't enough for three. I was very happy to be with this young man, yet I thought to myself if my husband knew, he'd be very upset because of it. I decided he wouldn't really be very upset. It gets a little confused after this, but at some time or other I was back upstairs again and going up on the 84th floor going down to the ground floor again. And this time a lot of other people were going down the stairs with me because I persuaded them it was faster than the elevator. Everybody was hurrying down just as fast as they could, including this one man who was pushing this other man in a wheelchair. Everyone was rushing him and he was going as fast as he could, but, of course, he was going a little bit slower than everybody else, so everybody was passing him.",

    "report":"I was standing right inside the window of one room and Bill C was standing inside the window of another room. The room that he was in was a bathroom. He had just gotten out of the shower so he didn't have any clothes on. He looked different than in waking life. He was much heavier and even in the face didn't look the same. We saw each other standing inside the window so he called out of the window from the room he was in and through the window of the room where I was. But then we saw in a distance that Jane C was there. So we got concerned and he quickly went back. Tried to quickly get back without her seeing us. I guess maybe she was headed towards us. She didn't catch us. The place where we lived was my home now in waking life. I had come home and the front door was open. But it looked like something was going on next door also. I wondered if they were getting it ready for someone new to move in. It looked like they had put black blinds on the windows. I noticed those and thought how nice they looked. But my front door was standing open. I hesitated at the door trying to decide whether to go in or not. I realized that it was the maintenance men that were in there. They had brought in a lot of equipment. You can hardly even get into the kitchen. At some point I wondered if I was finally getting my new windows but I don't think that's what they were doing. There were a lot more than the 3 or 4 maintenance men that work here in waking life. Tim U is the only one I recall from waking life. Maybe the other men were subcontractors. As soon as they saw me they realized that they had forgotten to put plastic down on the carpet before they started coming in and out and working there. As a result there were black footprints all over the carpet. They quickly started putting something down on the carpet. They put some of it down on top of the black footprints. Now Jane C either came in or was there and I just noticed her. She was using a vacuum and cleaning up the black stuff on the carpet. We were trying to figure out how to get rid of these clones of us. We decided that we needed to use a time machine and travel back in time. We realized that the three of us needed to travel together. Myself and whoever I was married to and our daughter. We would go back to a period in time that we had visited previously and created this clone, we went back to that period of time. We would find them and not tell them why we were there. I don't know that they even realized that we were clones or that we were from a different time or anything. We had to come up with a reason to get all three of them in the same room and standing next to each and very close to us. As soon as we did that something happened that took a second and they just disappeared. Whatever we did took a split second and they disappeared. It seemed that there were a lot of different ones all in one time period. It was almost as though we realized that all of the clones existed in one time period and we realized that we could get rid of all of them at once if we could get them all in the same room at one time. So we had done this but we also realized this time that some of the clones looked very different. Like the teenage daughter in one of these clone families looked like a very old woman and she was maybe only 3 feet tall. She had shoulder length, full, grey hair. In the face looked like an old woman. The way she walked and carried herself was very much like an old woman. She is the only one that I remember specifics about the differences in appearance. It was at that point, where we had gotten them all in the room together, and we started making them disappear one family at a time. We were doing quickly enough that it didn't cause a problem.",

I had been riding on a ride for little kids at the fair. Then a real (horse)... the horse had been attached to the merry-go-round and then he graduated to carrying and then he didn't want to follow the traffic signs so he did a U-turn in the West Village and stomped right over, all over everywhere because of these bent wire tree guards shaped like church windows--the stained glass kind. Then I could see why he was so upset. He (His) leg had been chopped off at the ankle. You could see exactly. I was flying the jet and not doing a very good job of it. I wasn't paying attention and didn't see the red blinking light. I couldn't remember if the guy said for me to push the levers down or up, so I pulled up and the jet's tail was scraping along the highway and making sparks fly. I said, \"DOWN.\" The guy had to siphon oil from his car to put in the jet and he kept shaking his head in disbelief. The lady at the film and TV party made a joke about 10 hits of codeine. I had boxes to mail and clothes were everywhere. I had fun at the girls' and loved them and tried on some crazy outfits and even some lingerie, but I had to get going to mail my boxes and draw the Brooklyn Bridge in black, blue and red on a NY Times full page double spread ad that had lots of white space. I filled it up beautiful. The Brooklyn Bridge drawing was finished in the paper. It advertised nothing. Because I didn't get the jet in the right place, the store rent and was closed and the jet pilot fixed spaghetti, tomato sauce and raw fillet slabs of sword fish and it was TERRIBLE. So I went to changed my clothes and fell down the hill--but I only told him and my mother I was going to change clothes because I knew they'd say NO if I told them I was going to roll down the hill. The hill was huge, with grass, real green and scattered yellow, \"daisy-type\" flowers.",

The oak paneling is old (like Shakespeare's time). I feel frustrated, so I go sit outside the structure, but on stage. Somewhere chair people in the audience start chanting, \"Slyvie\" as a joke and I call out, \"No political announcements.\" They laugh with me. The play begins with the man in a chair dancing rock and roll. I decide to go up one level to see better. I go up an elevator, then it's time to go back down, and I come out of the elevator to darkness. I am afraid. I realize two men are backstage and one has a gun.

    "report":"I dreamed that I and my wife were at my wife's parents' home in her hometown. I was going to take some peyote and we had a peyote plant which looked like a big orange carrot. I ate the plant directly and was rather surprised it didn't taste nauseating. It tasted pretty much like a carrot. Then I waited for some sort of effect to take place. I started getting some images and the like and feel a little bit detached. At this point one of my aunts from my hometown, a woman in her late 40's, my Aunt Hillary, got into the act somehow because she seemed to be outside waiting for effects. I was laying in bed waiting for some effects. Then I thought I may have to go to the bathroom. There was a toilet right beside the bed and I got on the toilet to defecate. My aunt walked into the room about this time. I was slightly embarrassed, but she didn't seem to be, so I got over mine. Then she went out again. When I finished, I got back in bed, still waiting for some effects. Then the next thing I recall is that I'm laying in bed again and my wife and my sister-in-law are telling me that I really had a tremendous effect. My behavior was really unusual. I don't know what they're talking about because I don't remember a thing. It  seems as if I had some very strong peyote effects, but I was totally amnesic for the whole episode. I strained my memory trying to recall what had happened, and I  just couldn't recall a thing. It was quite incredulous. I wasn't sure whether they were pulling my leg. They showed me a note I had written during the height of the peyote experience. They showed me some psychological tests of some sort I had taken then and I began to believe them. I had apparently had this thing and had complete amnesia for it. The peyote effect seems to be over. I come back home to the city where I go to graduate school  to pick up something. I'm starting to come back to my wife's hometown. I had the stuff in our car. The car seems to be a confused cross between our old car and new car which we just got a few days ago. I meet a friend of mine, another psych grad student, who knows quite a bit about cars. Eventually he and I decide to trade our cars, with me giving him an extra $50. His car is a little red convertible, a foreign sports car. I'm having difficulty learning how to drive it because a number of controls they use I just can't figure out, including a strange sort of parking brake that only works while the car is in gear, not when the car is in neutral. One time while I'm driving, the car seems to shrink down. It seems I'm driving a child's toy. I don't know how this car business eventually turns out, but I end up back in my wife's hometown. I get there and I believe my wife and I talk a little bit more about my peyote experience. I'm apparently tired or something, as my wife wants me to go to bed. I'm wearing pajamas and robe at this point. I go into the bedroom where I've had peyote, where my sister-in-law, who is about 18, is taking a nap or sleeping in the bed where I was. My wife seems to think it's alright and I should crawl in beside her and take a nap. So I start getting into bed. My sister-in-law complains cause she doesn't want to wake and move over. But I tell her to move over and she says for me not to touch her. She's naked in bed. I climb in beside her and curl around her. She sort of twitches around a little bit, but eventually gets settled. I have the urge to say I'm still under the influence of peyote and I'm not responsible for what I do, but I know that's not so, so I don't say it. I don't recall what happens after that.",

I needed to get from one building to the other and the only way I could get there was by boat. There was no motor so I had to use oars. I didn't have trouble getting to the new location but found it much more difficult to get back. It started raining and storming again and the flooding water became very active and extremely dangerous. People were panicking and scrambling to figure out a way to save themselves from drowning. A lot of people were unsuccessful and died. Some family members present. In a two-story house. Someone brought me a crying baby. It wasn't an infant, but old enough to hold its head up and to almost sit up itself. It was a relative. I think it was a boy. The baby was in a seated position on my right arm. I gently pushed his head down against my shoulder while I began a rocking motion and stroked his head to calm him and help him go back to sleep. Someone offered to take him from me and I told him that it was fine. I said he was scared and just needed to be comforted until he fell back to sleep. I took him back into the house and up to the second floor. The storm had been causing a lot of internal damage. I was trying to clean up some of the damage even though the storm was still going on and still causing lots of damage. Matthew, as an adult, was there. I placed a drawer back in a dresser. As I did so Matthew walked out of the room and I broke down, saying that Matthew, referring to him as a baby, had died. I dropped face down onto the bed and was sobbing. Darren was standing at the doorway saying something to try to comfort me but he was making it sound like it was no big deal. This made me very angry. I continued to sob. The dream starts over from the beginning. This time I and a few other people know what's coming so we start doing things to try to keep people from dying this time. One of the locations where I was had something like a bomb shelter. They opened the door and were trying to encourage people to go in because they knew they would be safe there. Several people had small boxes of herbal tea bags with strings and the little square of paper attached as though they had been individually wrapped. They hadn't been though. They were telling people to reach into the box and take one per person as they would help keep them safe. I knew I didn't have one the first time around so I made sure to get one this time. I didn't feel the same fear this time. I was still feeling, emotionally and physically, the seriousness of the situation. I don't think I felt the same fear or anxiety. Maybe because I knew what was coming and we had a chance to prepare.",

All of these people dressed in black, with black hoods over their faces, came running up outside the trailer. They had guns and surrounded the trailer. Someone said something about a certain song and that a certain song prompted them to come after us. Bob F called a radio station and asked them to play this song. Bob F turned it up very loud so they could hear it outside hoping it would make them leave. They didn't. They just opened fire. I was holding Rachel S. We were all running around, screaming. We didn't know where to go. We were trying to find a place to hide to avoid the gunfire. I felt the gunfire rip down my back. I heard someone yelling for Todd A. It didn't seem that any time had passed and I was walking around trying to find everyone. I kept saying something to Bob F and he wouldn't answer me. I reached up and touched his face and he just brushed it as though he had felt something. I realized then that I had died and that he couldn't see or hear me. I started walking through the trailer and I saw BJ. I said something to BJ and she turned around and said something to me. I said, Oh. You can see me. She said, Of course I can see you. Then I saw Bev. Bev made me realize that she had not made it either. At that point I realized that BJ was getting ready for our funeral. John S had survived but I don't know if he was there. Someone said that he was pretty much living in a daze now. He was being very technical. I realized that I had saved Rachel S. I started screaming and crying, I saved Rachel S. I saved Rachel S. I saved Rachel S. Bob F had survived. Somewhere along here Jennifer F came in. In listening to things I realized it was all her fault. Something she had done caused all these people to come after her and instead they ended up killing some many of us, but not her. Somebody said Bill F hadn't spoken since this happened. I thought that was additionally hard on Mother and Daddy. Apparently they had survived. I know that Bev and I died. But I don't know who else. I think Todd A did. I saw Rachel S and I called her. She was with Bev. Because she is so young she can see us and hear us. I went up to her and I said, Rachel S, come here. She came to me and I hugged her. But then she started coughing. I said something to somebody or somebody said something. She was getting sick and if they didn't hurry she would die. Somebody, some emergency workers, took her and put her on a stretcher. There was some man there that could talk to the dead. He was talking to the emergency workers and to Bev. I don't know if they saved her or not.",

The door is on the wall facing the end of my bed slightly to my left. There is a large distance between the end of my bed and the door. I had either been asleep or I was just on the verge of falling asleep. A black man enters my room and heads straight towards me with the intention of harming me in some way. Just as he reaches the end of my bed, someone else enters the room and physically tackles him to the floor. Once these two people are out of my room I get out of my bed and go across the hall into another much larger room that has several beds in it. All of the bids had patients in them. I asked a nurse if I could sleep with one of the patients in that room that night. She was hesitant. But I pointed out that in one of the beds there is a very large poodle, dog, sleeping rather than a patient. There are several smaller dogs, I think they're puppies, also sleeping in that bed. The puppies aren't poodles. I tell her that that is the bed that I went to sleep in, so she agrees. I get in the bed and I am practically lying on top of the poodle. I am now a dog. I am telepathically communicating with this poodle. The poodle is not the mother of the puppies, yet she is nursing them. My initial communication with the poodle is about why I am there, why I wanted to sleep there. It feels safer or comforting. I don't know if I am communicating this to the poodle or if I am just thinking about how it feels to be laying there next to this big soft fluffy poodle. She is lying on her side with her paws stretched out to the side. She's very hungry. She never moves. Yet somehow she eats. As she does there is a liquid substance that comes out of her mouth. It is mostly clear but has white spots. This is an indication that something is wrong with her. I don't know if I actually say something to the nurse about this or if I'm just thinking about saying something to the nurse. This would indicate to me that I am now human. I'm having a conversation with this nurse about the 12 finalists from the last season of American Idol who were coming in to entertain patients at the hospital. There's something about having refreshments while they are there. The hospital staff is getting ready for their arrival. Just as they arrive we realize that there are no paper cups, paper plates, napkins, etc. I tell them that I have some that we can use and I think it's Taylor that says he will go with me to get them.",

When he sees me, he hurriedly gets up and gets on a rider mower too and helps cut the grass. I let the baby and Charla play in the yard as I look around. I see that it's a large, square yard that ends abruptly on the left side at a hedge. The left side is just a thin strip of lawn. Beyond the yard is a dry and brown landscape, obviously without care or water, somewhat like M City. I notice the contrast between the lush yard and the surrounding landscape. Then I look for Charla and see her in a tree eating something. I get concerned. I call her to me and demand to know what's in her mouth. I see a long, thin thing like are on oak or some kind of tree that may grow nuts. I want her to open her mouth and she stubbornly refuses. I pry her mouth open and find, instead of the horse chestnut things, a bunch of small plastic packages that sewing things come in. I pull them out saying, \"You could swallow these things and get sick. Don't put these in your mouth.\" I take them back to the porch where a box is that the sewing things belong in. I replace them, hoping the old man doesn't notice. He comes up and sees, but is not concerned.",

It would say something like, #1 and what it was. Then I would tell them what they should be filling in there. Like, a lot of them were just general what they should be filling in but some were very specific. So on some of them I was telling them a specific name to check or fill in. One of the items I didn't know what it was. It was a very strange word. It sounded something like, Imagonnagohome! So I was standing on this stage with a microphone. I was joking about it. When I first got started, the microphone that I was supposed to use wasn't working. Then I was supposed to be standing in front of the stage using this microphone. That microphone wasn't working so they brought me around and up on stage and gave me a different microphone. I was using that one and we were still having problems. I was making jokes to try to make light of the technical problems we were having. It was mostly men that I was working with. It seemed that I was observing these children of this wealthy man. He didn't have time for his children, so they were not well behaved. They were spoiled because he spent lots of money on them instead of spending time with them. They were going to play bride and groom. The young girl, she was very large and well developed for her age, was half-dresses in her wedding outfit. She kept yelling at the little boy to bring her dress. He wouldn't do it. Then I'm back at the event. I was going to lay down and watch the rest of it.

    "report":"I dreamed there was this girl, and sometimes it was me and sometimes it was another girl, who'd been hired by my father to count how many trucks of this company (it was the Lion Co.) came into this city along this certain road. And this was because they wanted part of his business, but all of the other trucking firms already had all the business or most of it. And she was hired to live in this very, very fancy penthouse, it was sort of her pay for the job. And she would sit there, with a pair of binoculars, and count the trucks. But then there were these people - it was very sort of science-fiction story-like - who were going to take over the city, and then take over the world. And they had done something in the city, so almost everybody was dead or not there any more, but I and another girl who later turned out to be my sister , and my husband were there. And we were in this big apartment house. And a car stopped in front of it. They were going to come in and search for us. And so we were trying to hide. And I looked around for all sorts of places for us to hide, mainly for me and Barbara, and I was looking for a place for my sister first, and then I was going to hide. And finally my sister decided that in this big closet, sort of one of these dressing room types of closets, very large, that she was going to hide. And she had covered herself partly with boxes and partly with a blanket. But she refused to keep her face covered, because it bothered her. And yet I said that she had to, or these people would find her. And finally I -- after trying to persuade her -- I had to quit and run and hide myself, behind some clothes over in back of the closet, because I could hear these people outside. And they came in and found us both, and had also found my husband wherever he was, and were going to take us away. And we all threw away our I.D. cards because they marked us as being part of the nobility and everybody who belonged to the nobility was going to be killed. And they were going to take us to a prison camp somewhere, but we knew that we would maybe have another chance to get away. And so then it was I and these two other girls. And we were trying to get away from this place that looked like a girl's school. And a bell had rung and everybody was supposed to come back, but we went on and were out near this woods. And some girls that were near there told us not to go down there, because nobody that went down there could ever find their way out. But we knew that was just what we wanted, because we wanted to get away. And so we ran down into the woods. And we hadn't gone very far until we saw my husband lying on the ground with this picnic basket with him. And this seemed sort of innocuous, but we knew -- since he was now on the enemy side -- that he was there to prevent our escaping. And yet it didn't concern me too much because I was very happy to see him, and felt very tender toward him. And I went up to him, and where he was, and lay down and embraced him, and said how sad it was that we were on opposite sides, and supposed to be enemies. And so we were going to stay there with him, and that was about the end of that dream.",

    "report":"I dreamed that I was driving along in the mountains behind a large truck, and we were coming down out of the mountains into this valley. And the truck gave me a signal to pass him, but I didn't think I could see far enough ahead, so I didn't. And we came to a railroad track which was right in the center of the valley, cutting across it. and off of a sudden a little signal flashed on, and I shouted to the driver of the truck to stop. And we stopped, and this train came up from the left and started to go across, and then another train came up in the opposite direction. And the engineer of the first train got out and told everyone who was waiting in the station to get out of the valley as quickly as they could, because there was something about the strong winds in the meadows, that often trains were wrecked as they tried to cross it. And so we went across the valley and up the other side - it wasn't a very wide valley, with very steep mountains on either side - as quickly as we could. And we were on a flight of stairs about halfway up, and decided to stay there a little while and look back into the valley and see if anything did happen to the train when it crossed the valley. And we (my husband, Bill Gammet, and my daughter was with us), there were a couple of other people there. And Bill and I went up to the top of this tower that was right beside us, but decided that we couldn't see as well from there as we had before, so we went back and looked down. And down at the foot of where we were now was the train station. And the train started to come into it. And something happened. The engine pulled away from the rest of the train, and the train started slowly, very slowly, without any noise, to crumple up. And it was sort of horrible and sort of not. It was most horrible because it was a passenger train. And yet there was -- well, not this air of unreality -- about it, but although I thought I should be very horrified by it, I wasn't. So I said that we should go down and help these people. And I went down. And besides the people in the train, there didn't seem to be too many people outside interested in what was going on. A couple of men were carrying a couple of bodies by. And I went inside. And the people who were sitting around the counters and at the booths at this little lunch counter were saying that they wouldn't move, but I told them very commandingly that if they didn't stay and help all these people who were sick -- who were hurt in this accident -- they could leave at once. And so they all got up and left. And I told the waitresses behind the counter to start fixing lots of hot water, and I started fixing the tables and everything for the doctors to put patients down on to see. And there weren't any doctors around. And I asked my sister to call some from the phone book. And she called a couple, but there seemed to be difficulty in getting any doctors to come. And I went out to the train, after a little while. And another train was going by this wrecked one, which, incidentally, all the shades were down over the window and you couldn't see in, and there was no noise from inside. But there were these two little boys that looked like twins sitting down inside the windowsill of the end car. And they waved at the train that passed. And I went down and they seemed to be very cheerful and asked them if they had been in the train wreck. And I asked them if they were hurt and they said yes, they were. And one little boy unzipped his jacket and he had this long pink plastic or iron thing, sort of like a knitting needle, stuck through part of his belly, and the other little boy had a similar thing in his arm. and I told them to not bother those things and leave them there til the doctor could look at them. And I went back inside and I thought, there's nothing I can do until the doctor gets here, because, except perhaps get somebody to move the people who were obviously dead out of the train, because I knew you shouldn't move people who had been injured until you knew the extent of their injuries. And at this point I began to wake up. But something told me that this was my problem, I should solve it. And I in some ways had caused this, or there was something of significance in it for me. And so I tried to stay asleep and figure out some way to handle this great catastrophe, but I couldn't seem to figure out a way. That was all.",

[Lynn owned several oil wells in Utah, and we worked them together.]  It was night, very dark, and I was alone.  I was kneeling by the side of a dirt road, by a gulley or culvert.  It was rainy, and the ground was runny like I'd seen and noticed earlier out here.  I was just out there, without a car, existing outside, noticing my surroundings and the ground.  I was close to the ground.  I was glad to be there.  I felt proud somehow, or privileged, almost like when firefighting, a privileged position about being there that provides much satisfaction.  I noticed to my right there was a black car on a smaller side road.  It was behaving strangely or surreptitiously.  It would back up slowly and then stop.  It was kind of hiding behind some small trees or branches, not letting itself be seen.  And it was way too late for it to be out there for any good reason.  At first I thought I might get its attention.  I was thinking somehow I could share or show my pride or happiness at being out there.  I felt I belonged there or had a right to be there, so if the person in that car noticed me, it was okay.  I even thought I might get a ride or meet the person or something, or we would share some connection to the field.  Then it hit me how dangerous it was.  That car was hiding out or running from something or just up to no good.  And it was so late.  I was a woman alone way out here without a car.  Then I got the feeling the person in the car was actually looking for me, to harm me.  I realized how naive and stupid and dangerous it was for me to think it was okay if they saw me, that they'd just pass.  I was sure now, convinced, that the man in that car would rape me if he saw me out here alone.  I stayed still, but then tried to hide myself so he wouldn't see me.  I didn't think he'd seen me yet.  I was a little hidden already, being so low to the ground, and it was so dark.  I tried to or thought about getting lower, into the culvert below me.  If I could just get down there, I felt I could hide.  I was in that process when I saw his car move quickly, toward the dirt road I was on.  I was by then terrified, I knew he would rape me, and probably kill me out here.  I had worked myself into a panic of fear.  I woke up, feeling like it was Lynn in the car, but also a stranger.",

I say, \"Oh is this a kiln where you nest the wet clay mold into the embers and cook it?\" She says yes, then, through the windows I see Clare, red fluffy feathers. She's pretty and she's annoyed with me for being at her mom's. I explain, then I hear a small black-haired baby girl in pink crying. I pick her up and rock her, singing, \"Sugar Baby\" over and over. The mother of the baby is annoyed. I didn't ask permission and she sings a different song, \"Sug--\" a short version of Sugar. I match her song!

    "report":"I was back in school. I was lost in the hallways. I found the art students but it was not my day to take art. They had newsprint pads and practiced figures in charcoal the first day of school. They were younger than me. It was my day to take writing. I couldn't find my class but I knew if I saw Jasmine or Eileen it was the right one. I was wearing a sarong with a white t-shirt. I taped my story to the white sarong tied into a skirt. I was staying at Corinne's family's. There was a plague. The sky filled with dark spots--locusts, angry--clumping up thick and mucus-y on the way down. They catapulted straight through canopies and made your eyes fill with mucus and swell shut so you couldn't see. School children were screaming. I got inside out of the raining locusts and asked a man what it was. He said a certain kind of pollen--the next county over had gotten out of control and when the spray truck sprayed insecticide it gummed up the pollen and this county didn't have the antidote and it was painful but harmless. I got a grocery cart and got groceries. Toys and appliances were mixed with the groceries--it was hard to tell front from back. I looked at Chinese vegetables but I got a strawberry popsicle. I was walking home eating my popsicle and I dropped it and Brittany came with a spoon to help me scrape it off the road and save some. She had a lot of it. I had the rest. Brittany's sister, Corinne, was underwater--playing with a boy who was already dead. They were doing back flips and somersaults in the water but when anybody else came around they played dead--him lying flat on his stomach lifeless. I liked to watch them play underwater in slow motion without gravity--their hair floating in front or behind them. The neighbors were from Cuba. They sat in the backyard. I kept getting lost and wandering into different Cuban's yards. The old man didn't mind. He showed me how to get back to the main road more than once. Rudy had written a play and they were acting it out when the locusts came. We tried to keep some kind of order--but with raining locusts, mucus eyes and everybody wanting a popsicle, rehearsals weren't going too good. I made a list of notes. The main character--a black lady who cooked--took the list with her and crinkled it up in her hand--and held onto it--as if she could feel the suggestions better than reading them.",

    "report":"I've just gotten married to this wonderful guy who lives in a (little?) suburban house (a sort of 50's-VA-ranch-style). He's got light brown hair, tallish, handsome, friendly, and very sweet. I've only just moved in and still feel very tentative, disoriented. The house has this one big room that he uses as a club on Saturday nights, all the young people come and dance. [We're talking about 20-35 really, age-wise.] We've been getting everything ready, actually he's been running around doing things and I've pitched in where I could. There's also a friend of his - a girl, old friend from school or the neighborhood - helping out, she's very nice, helped me feel welcome. Now people are arriving, quite a lot of them, and there's a lot to do, taking their coats, getting drinks, etc.At some point I've gone to the bathroom, and the door latch wouldn't catch, so I just have to hope nobody walks in. It's a long bathroom with some sort of partition in it, and a worktable. The girlfriend is sitting at it, and my husband apparently starts to come in, because she starts talking to him rather loudly, in such a way as to keep him outside the room, for my benefit. I'm not enjoying all this bustle a lot, and I go off into another part of the house to get away for a while. It's all very new, this place, this town, living with this man, being married - I haven't know him long, we just fell for each other like a ton of bricks and I wanted to be with him so much I'd do anything. Now I'm wondering if I can get used to it, if I fit in. Do I even want to be married? I go across the street and visit with some older neighbors, still feeling confused. After a bit, people start pouring out of the house - first a clump, then a clump, then a stream. They seem to be excited about something, all talking and hurrying. I can't see or hear what's going on so I go out front, and I hear bits of sentences, about fire, and my husband's name. Some of them see me and stop talking, but I also hear, \"(he's) dead\" [I don't know his name] a time or two. I'm dumbfounded. I look at the house, expecting to see flames burst out of the windows, but all there is, is a big plume of white smoke coming from one area of the house. Thoughts go through my head about how ironic it is to be only just married and now not be again, will everything just go back to normal? But I have to know what's happened - I rush into the house, stumbling through rooms, past overturned furniture, till I come to where he is, and he's alive - there are firemen around, they've got the fire out and a lot of things are wet, including my husband. He looks exhausted, and he's very cold, he's done something heroic that saved the day but now he's all wet and suffering somewhat from shock. The girlfriend has a trench coat over his shoulders that she's trying to keep around him, but it's wet too. When I see him I scream and rush to him - suddenly my doubts are all gone, I know I want to be with him whatever it takes, I love him so much. I pull the coat off of him [and either he's naked, or I get his other clothes off him] and hold him tight, wrapping myself around him tight to give him my body heat. He says something about the fire, how apparently it burned up this little wooden thing he'd bought for me, how ironic that was - we'd been talking about it earlier, we'd seen it in a shop or at a craft fair and I'd loved it - a little box of 2 exotic woods, how unusual it was, and it cost $275. That's very expensive, and of course we said we couldn't afford it, but he'd gotten it for me anyway on the sly. I look around to see what happened to it, but I don't spot it, even though I see some other little nice wood things.",

    "report":"In this dream I was very much afraid of this woman because I knew that she wanted to kill my daughter and me. It was a very irrational thing and unmotivated. There would be no reason for it, but she wanted to do it. Although I had been in the habit of leaving my doors unlocked and everything, I started locking them all the time, and I pictured several times in my mind very vividly her coming in and shooting us and shooting thru the walls or something, killing my daughter and me or both. And then in this dream and exactly how this happened, I'm not certain, but my daughter had to do something and was going to be there at some railroad station or something for some reason, and this woman knew it. And I was going to follow her and she was going to stab her and my husband was going to try to stop her, but there would be a very slight chance - because apparently this railroad station was in a very big city somewhere - and if he missed her once, then it would be too late. I was in this big city and the locale of this dream sort of shifted around right fluidly and I was looking out of the hotel window and I saw this woman slowly going along toward the railroad station. I wanted to call up my husband and tell him that I had seen her, and I couldn't find the number in my book. I looked up Dick Tracy, is what I was looking up. It was a different city and I couldn't get them. Anyway, I was back in my apartment in my university town, and I was frantic and I didn't know what to do and I thought, \"Well, I'll call over at the psychiatric lab where he works and I will talk to them because I know he won't be there and send the police or do something. There must be something somebody can do because of this crazy woman, without trying to kill my daughter.\" So I picked up the phone and we have a party line and somebody was on it. I rattled up the receiver and asked them to please get off because this was an emergency. They just ignored me. I asked again for them to please get off because this was really an emergency and I had to use the phone for 5 minutes, and they wouldn't. Apparently whoever it was had this attitude that if they couldn't use the phone for whatever conversation they were carrying on, I couldn't use it either. Finally I said, \"Can't you spare the phone for five minutes so I can save my little daugher's life?\" but they ignored me, so I ran out of the house and I ran down thru the apartments looking for somebody who had a phone that I could use. And finally I went in the last apartment and nobody was there, so I decided I would use their phone. And there was nobody on the line here, but the phone wouldn't work right. It had a very funny dialing system which I finally got to work and called up over there and got the man who's in charge, a man -- a doctor -- who's in charge, and I told him, I said wasn't there anything they could do because there was this crazy woman who was trying to kill my daugher. He said, \"Oh, you mean the one who is trying to stab her? I know about that.\" He just had this very casual attitude towards it, and I was very upset because I knew that she had killed her by this time. I knew nobody could have stopped her and I said, \"Well, can anything be done to protect people from people like this?\" He said yes. So I saw that she could be arrested now and put in jail or asylum for the rest of her life, but it wouldn't do any good to us because our daugher would already be dead.",

I accept, and confess I'd like to see some of the tourist thing like the Paul Bunyan monument. He grimaces, but agrees. I have one more table set up, for a prom. Another woman says, \"It's going to be hard.\" I take a pretty blue cloth that has velcro across the top and try to get it to evenly cover a board. It won't go on evenly. I keep trying.

Both kinds of soup had 6-sided oyster crackers floating in the soup. The workers could nibble crackers but NOT you. So on the way up the hill I had to pass by the place where the escaped convict was hiding out. It turned out to be a huge misunderstanding. We both loved convenience stores. At the red store, department [the red department store] there were heavy duty shopping bags of freebies for the poor propped up next to the door. There were thick big robes but just too heavy to wear and too thick and very ugly. Those robes were USELESS to anybody. A huge necklace was on top of a bag full of coat hangars.

Novelettes. I got both books and was surprised. They didn't ask about my overdue books. I also picked out a Dick Tracy picture book. I left the library with my books and I ran into Sonny Klienfield sitting on a bench on a bridge. We started looking at my books together. Then I had to leave and I ran into Zeb on the other side of the bridge. He was carrying many plastic bags of costumes. We pulled them out and tried them on for Sonny. Sonny liked Zeb a lot. Zeb was busy and forgot to take his bags with him. I put on a mans' beige cardigan with dark, dark trim. About 3\/8.\" I said, \"Sonny, Zeb left his stuff all over the place.\" And he said, \"You should be glad you have a nice man.\" Zeb was not my man, but Sonny was right. Scott was sitting on the wooden couch looking at pictures of castles. He called them rooks. I called them castles. He was trying to think of the place this castle was. Somewhere out of state, he said. He said, \"It's not swamps but like swamps.\" I said, \"QUICKSAND!\" He said, \"No, like swamps, but not swamps; with grass chest high. I was sitting in a school desk. A girl in the row to my left, right across from me was very, very annoying. She was a model\/actress. She was going on and on about her head shots and disrupting everybody and finally I went off in a tirade to her. I was mad. I said, \"You should put as much effort into your acting and forget about the head shots for now.\" She was simpering. I said, \"you should quit whining.\" She was looking at a book of photographers and bragging about her Mother. She flipped the pages of the catalog and kept complaining and I said, \"WOULD YOU SHUT UP!\" I looked behind me and Mary Reynaldie was taking it all in with amusement. Her eyes were thinking. My father was making home made peach ice cream and you could tell when it was ready because it started coming out of the top. I was in charge of scooping it into 12 Dixie Cups. my father liked vanilla wafers with his. Soggy in ice cream. I was running a race and I forgot about the finish line. A little girl was balancing her bicycle on the curb, trying to get to the very top of the hill. [I assumed the finish line was at the top of the hill, but I was wrong] Exterminator inspectors came into the apartment. I said, \"I'm busy now.\" He said, \"You'll be busy later too.\" So I kept doing what I had to do of everything around Zeb's bags and my books and the clutter. I didn't have time to be concerned about my mess. I followed him through the door. He had a vacuum cleaner. I thought, \"He sure cleaned up my kitchen fast.\" There were 2 brand new duck head phones and a fax machine on the kitchen table. I loved the new phones he put in. It was sparkly clean. He said, \"This is NOT your kitchen, it's your neighbors.' \" I knew he was right. WE went back to my messy place. 3 messages. I hit \"play.\" I had left a message on the answering machine telling Dora how much I loved her and missed her. I could not remember where I called from.",

The table to which I am attached has for diners Alan Stone, his father, his father's son (Stone, Jr.) who doesn't seem to be a brother of Stone, and the wife of his father's son. Stone, Jr., is a rather slender, young man, about 6 ft. tall, and perhaps 27 years old. His features are clean cut and his complexion healthy. I seem to be a little ways back from the table, almost directly behind Prof. Stone, who now turns to his right, evidently trying to turn around far enough to offer me his hand to shake. He says, \"Then .... \" shake in a hearty tone, and I realize (unpleasant realization as I detest secret societies) that he is intending to give me the secret shake of some organization, to which, he believes mistakenly, I belong. Says he is sure I am a \"No\" (meaning Sigma No) through he goes on to say that the \"Xi\" (meaning Sigma Xi) is almost as good. I explain that I am a \"Xi,\" but not a \"No,\" whereupon he withdraws his hand with a holier-than-thou gesture. He then looks closely for the sigma Xi key on the watch chain in my trousers watch pocket. finding none he asks me to explain. I reply, \"I do not choose to wear one.\" He seems, at first, astonished or even dumbfounded at my heretical statement, and makes it clear that he is greatly disappointed in me. He fairly exudes disapproval. Stone, Jr., who previously had seemed a pleasant fellow and very friendly to me, now took up the .... , and indirectly threatened to give the story of my disloyalty and heresy to a newspaper, which would hound me and ruin my reputation. All of them except Alan band against me, and a bitter hatred for their pretensions, hypocrisy, and imagined superiority (they had on dress clothes whereas I was in ordinary business suit) rose in me. At the same time I feel, if the worst comes to the worst, and my life is threatened with ruin, I can perhaps save something by explaining to the judge that my disrespectful attitude toward Prof. Stone, and my suggestion to Stone, Jr., that he mind his own business, were the result of my sudden anger. It also occurs to me that, in the event of losing my job, I can go on to a small farm. I now leave the banquet room and walk along a carpeted corridor in search of the elevator. After walking a considerable distance, I turn to my left down a short, dimly lighted corridor. A door way to my left looks something like entrance to elevator shaft, but I am unable to find any button for summoning the elevator. There is a radio going inside this room and I wonder a little that the management would permit such a disturbance. Soon I begin to retrace my steps, and notice another man, who evidently had made same mistake as I did, turning around also. The elevator shaft, identified by some grating of wood, is now plainly seen -- I must have walked past it before. Before I can reach elevator, the door closes and it starts to .... however before I hear someone ask for floor 6, which now seems to be the next floor down. I am fairly certain that the Stone party were on the elevator. It seems likely that I could catch elevator on next floor down, by running down the stairway but that doesn't appeal to me, even though I am still so angry with Stone that I am very anxious to add certain names to the list I had previously applied to him, but which in the stress of the argument slipped my mind. This works on me to the point of inducing me to run down stairs and perhaps catch elevator at bottom. The stairs are broad, carpeted, and not long -- only about 18 to 20 steps per flight. There is a landing or balcony about 8 or 10 steps down from each floor, and on each balcony are several black waiters just finishing the laying of several tables for breakfast for the occupants of hotel. None is eating yet, however, and I am glad they do not see me -- as I now am in shirt sleeves. The colored waiters pay no attention to me whatever as I dash down the steps, whirl at bottom by grasping banister post, and tear on down. At one place a colored waiter, going considerably faster then I am going, passes me. Finally reach the bottom, and burst in on a scene of luxury and magnificence -- flowers, expensive drapes, and marvelous decorations of all kinds -- and the dining tables crowded with women in evening dresses. Just as I enter one of the women grabs another by the hair and shakes vigorously -- a regular cat fight.

It is potentially dangerous and we dive in and swim frantically, but not afraid. After a while, we see a pasture and farm buildings on the left bank. The fence is open and we swim over and get on land, deciding that this might be the prudent thing to do as we don't know how much worse the river will get around the bend. We walk toward the buildings and on my left I see lots of objects lined up and I think excitedly, \"How interesting, dream symbols.\" I wonder what they mean and I try to look at each one and remember what was there so I can write them down [I don't remember now what they were]. Then we see a big blackboard. We're visiting a classroom which is in this huge pasture area. On the blackboard the words, \"The vertical cannot be seen until the horizontal is understood\" are written and then I see drawn pictures of furniture where I can see the vertical lines and barely make out the horizontal ones. I am very impressed at the message from my dream and feel a moment of great insight. Now we are observing the class. I see a young boy and say, \"I'll bet I can guess your age.\" I'm about to guess 5th grade when he says, \"High school.\" I tell him I used to be a 3rd grade teacher and was glad I didn't show up my ignorance by guessing his age. I see some boys resting on mats on the floor for nap time. I place an object by one boy. I think I am returning it to him after looking at it. Then I share a couch with a girl. I curl up on it. There's not much room for me. I watch as the 3rd grade teacher, male, takes my daughter Dovre outside to play flute and music. The class is well behaved, everyone doing what they are supposed to be doing. Some of them look out the window at Dovre and the teacher. The teacher comes in with his face in a frown and a toothpick in his mouth. Someone comments that he's mad and you can tell because of the way his mouth is closed around the toothpick. He is annoyed with the students and I am surprised because I thought them well behaved. He didn't, however, and reprimands them to get back to what they are supposed to be doing.",

I'm going off to look for Lori, and the place is also a shopping mall. Didn't find her but I poke around in a toy store. Back to office. There's a wedding going on in a big room nearby. Polish or something - there are a lot of people in there. There's something I need to get - a plain white envelope - and after I look around I find they must be in the room where the wedding's going on, so I go through to the back of it past all these people. I'm very self-conscious, esp. since I don't have shoes on, and realize the staff is really supposed to stay out, and leave the people alone. But I get my envelopes and leave. A salesman comes by with some stationery products, starting his spiel as though I were the Purchaser - I explain to him that I'm not - I only talked to him when he was here before because I was interested in Christmas cards, but I didn't send any after all. He's a stocky short guy, foreign, dark, sort of prim, and he's a bit miffed now. He looks like he thinks I'm giving him the runaround, but I'm not. He leaves some cards with me to give to Linda. Mick Jagger comes over to say something. He's really quite a normal sort of guy, doesn't fool around. Not too much anyway - he's fun. However, I'm getting ready to move out of town. Next I'm in a house with my father and stepmother and brother and another girl. (My sister? - don't think so.) I'm probably a teenager. We've just moved in and don't know where things are, haven't got the furniture all in. Nice little old house. I go over where this closet is. It has a big chest of drawers affair in it, not wood, with a bin-opening at the top. It's tall. As I look at it, it moves a little, I see it's on wheels. I pull it out and find a real chest of drawers behind it, old, wood, painted white. I exclaim over this to my brother and what's-her-name, because now we've got plenty of drawer space. [Somehow I get a message - don't know if it's through the mail or I go outside the house or what, something unusual about it.] I get a letter that says the writer's coming to visit soon, and in a tacked-on note, Maxine too. But it's not signed and we're having to speculate who sent it. I figure it's Ted. He said he'd visit, but why Maxine? Why would she want to come out here?",

    "report":"I am watching TV early in the morning with my brother - watching Howard Stern. It's a TV version of his regular morning studio radio show, and he is just having discussions with people around in the office and there's a portion where there's barely anybody visible on the screen. My brother and I are occasionally having a conversation (not my real brother, by the way - bears some resemblance to the actor Robert Hayes - younger I suppose) - I'm in school and I think he is too. But for some reason he isn't going today. I'm supposed to go, and the later it gets the more at risk I am of being late. Bonnie is our mother - she's in another room, when the phone rings. I am supposed to be getting ready for school and it occurs to me that I'd better start moving. She comes back and says she has to go to - maybe it's the hospital - there is someone she knows in trouble and she has to go and help out somehow and I am asking if it's somebody I know - [she says a first name I don't remember right now] - she says, \"I have go right now\" - anyhow she's not answering the question. Seems kind of distracted, definitely quite worried - whatever is going on, it's very serious - I keep after her for several tries - [\"somebody\"] who? - is it the one I know? Do I know this person? \"Can I help?\" obviously is what I mean - and she eventually says, \"No, I don't think you do know her\", and I say, \"Well okay, but I just wanted to know.\" She goes (now I'm thinking Bonnie is my grandmother maybe) - meanwhile I go into the bathroom. The object is, I need to get ready for school - I've looked at the clock - or a clock, and discovered it's 10 in the morning - I'm really startled - school starts at 8, and the TV - well, the show goes on all morning, I'm thinking, \"Surely I haven't just sat and stared at the TV this long!\" I look at another clock, and it says 8 o'clock, which is bad enough, but how could the clocks be at 2 different hours? This is terrible! I had better get to school anyhow - this has really got me upset. I've never done anything like this before - certainly I may have been late some places before, but nothing like this, and at school they're gonna think that I've cut or something. This is terrible. But I go into the bathroom and there's stuff, everywhere that I want to use - the bathtub has something in it, some kind of cloth or maybe a shower curtain or something - the sink has corn on the cob in it - not whole pieces, small chunks - and that is just disgusting. (There's something else - I don't know if there's 2 sinks but there's something else I wanted to use that's clogged up with something.) I'mjust outraged and I know that my brother is responsible for at least the sink, because it's his stuff, and I think the bathtub too, and somebody else has left the other stuff and I am wanting to get this fixed up right now. I do not wish to do it myself - it's not my mess. I know I can't ask Bonnie to do it, and my brother - geez - he's a lazy bum himself. So I sort of throw my hands up for a while. Then I realize I can't remember my class schedule. I'm always late, but it seems like I haven't been in school in days and I can't remember what class comes when. This is really weird and disconcerting, and I know that when I get to school I can stop in the principal's office and ask where I'm supposed to be. But this is already just too weird a morning for me to handle already. I'm mad at my brother and even sort of mad at Bonnie, and I just don't know what to make of anything. Outside some people are arriving - I think they're my parents - and some other people, family - and I've gone outside - getting to be on my way to school - and I've stopped to greet them. My brother has for some reason shrunk very small and fallen into a drain hole - not a gutter, it's a round hole in the sidewalk and there's water rushing, rushing, rushing, underneath it. It's kind of as though he shrinks as he falls, really. I have a little vindictive pleasure at seeing him fall in there but at the same time, well, he's my brother, and he's going to get swept away and possibly killed, even, if I let him stay there. But he hangs on to something for a bit and I reach in and grab his legs and then pick him up kind of like a doll with my other hand behind his back and pull him back out again.",

The only incident I recall clearly was that my wife was sleeping in another room or cabin and I was sleeping on an upper bunk with the Diane-Cynthia person Her husband, who seemed pretty definitely Bob at this point, arranged some sort of blanket between us. I was pretending to be asleep during this. She had her legs against mine, despite the blanket, and after he went to bed, I was looking forward to curling around her. The next two incidents seem part of the same dream, although they are conceptually distinct. The last dream of the night, but I'm not sure which series came first, although I suspect the ticket one. I was driving along in a dual-control car. Harry Groddy was in the regular driver's seat, but I was driving from the other seat. We were driving along S. Broad St., where it is 4 lanes, in my hometown, behind another car that was going slowly, and I decided to pass, but seeing a policeman riding a motorcycle in front of the car, I changed my mind. The policeman waved me over and was giving me a ticket anyway, and I was arguing that I had probably not even accelerated to 40 in this 35-mile zone, and Harry backed me up. Why didn't he give a ticket to the guy who was following him too closely, instead of me? But he gave me the ticket anyway. The other series: There had been some sort of explosion in this big pit in Woodside, and I and others were investigating, particularly to see if it was radioactive. We started out in a bus. Then there was this interpolated incident, where I was at some place at the beach, watching the waves, and how this boat dock seemed to have been damaged by the waves. Then back on the bus, coming back from our investigation. There was no radioactivity involved. Nevertheless, some policemen were meeting the bus and going to arrest us, or at least escort us somewhere, because people thought we were behind the damage or explosion.",

Without saying so in so many words she lets us know that the hotel is a 2nd class one. It now seems that a man, evidently the manager of head waiter of the hotel, has been standing near by. He hands menu and order back to Andy (here it crosses my mind that I rarely take the responsibility of making out an order except for myself alone). Andy begins to write down our meal order, and has 3 items listed, the first of which is \"wax\" (which is beeswax and that in turn is honey) 55 cents.

    "report":"In the dream my wife and I are living in some city of the Soviet Union. We have done something or other which has greatly offended everybody who were formerly quite friendly to us. I go out of this one house where we were visiting people who were once our friends and were not mad at us. The man's wife is especially mad at me. So I go out of the house and go across the street, and want to do something to make amends. I'm apparently working as an architect and I decide I'll make a model of a new home for her, which will be just what she wanted and will serve as an apology. So I scoop up a big pile of snow and proceed to model a home out of it which stands about, oh, about 3 ft. high, I guess, several feet long. The snow takes on the proper colors the brick house has. It becomes red where the bricks are, some other color for the roof, flagstone on some of the porches; it takes on that color. It becomes a realistic and quite a nice-looking model home. About the time I was finishing modeling this, I looked up and someone was walking down the street and I think it looks familiar. Sure enough, it turns out to be an old friend of mine, Bob Ganders.  We greet each other and I ask him what he is doing in the city where I go to graduate school , and he tells me his little girl is very sick and he's brought her back to the hospital. It doesn't seem incongruous at the time that he's brought her back all the way from a large faraway city to the city where I go to graduate school . I tell him how sorry I am that she is sick, I'd do anything I can. We make small talk a minute.",

I started chatting with him online, though I don't know who contacted who or how we found each other. Online he called himself Sal CEO. Our first interactions were fun and playful. Within a few hours he had arrived at my house to meet me. He is fairly tall, has reddish brown short hair, wears glasses and medium build. He is a very nice man, and fun to be with. I was sharing a home with Darren and with Maureen U from the sleep center. They were married and lived primarily on the first floor of this home. Sal and I wanted some time alone to get to know each other but he was very nice about the fact that Darren and Maureen U were there. They were each dealing with some kind of problem in their life, each separately, and he was being very kind in allowing me to do what I needed to do for them. We were both engaging in conversation with each of them about whatever it was they were each dealing with. He noticed a bumper pool table across the room and suggested we play. I told him I didn't know how and he would have to teach me. I went over to the table and realized that there was a piece missing or something and told him we couldn't play because of this. He suggested another game that the four of us could play. We were preparing to do that. I noticed how dirty the tile floor was. It was covered in black footprints. I said something to Darren and Maureen U about it, almost scolding them, telling them that they could be a bit more conscientious about taking care of my home since I had agreed to let them stay there temporarily. I lived primarily upstairs while they were staying here, but shared some rooms of this floor. That's why Sal and I were down there instead of going upstairs. While we were getting ready to play this game Sal and I found ourselves alone in a room for a few seconds and he gave me a quick kiss on the lips. I could tell by the look in his eyes that he was going to do that before he did. It was nice. It was especially nice because it affirmed to me that he was enjoying being with me.",

    "report":"I was at NTNS talking to Jane H and Janet S. I was speaking mostly with Jane H as usual. Jane H was pricing some things to put on the sales floor and Janet S was helping customers. I asked Jane H about her daughter's wedding. She said it is in one week. I asked how Angie Ha is doing and she said fine. I asked about her soon to be son-in-law. She told me that he is a very good guy, but some of his friends were questionable. One of them is an ex-convict. She was still sure that the son-in-law is a very good guy. She was pricing some bright yellow bath towels. I commented about them because they were so large and very thick. They were very nice. She asked if I was interested in them because she used to price things special if she knew I wanted them. I told her I needed to stick to my budget so I better not. She then asked Janet S if she was interested in them. When she held them up for Janet S to look at them they were draperies and not towels. She also told Janet S the size but I don't remember the number exactly. I think it was 13 inches or 18 inches. Janet S decided she wanted them. I decided I needed to leave. As I was on my way out the door. I told them I was on my way to a wedding. I came back in and said it was the wedding of my first of six Godchildren. They were amazed that I had six Godchildren. I noted also that it was the first of my parent's grandchildren to be married. Chuck C was standing at the register preparing to make a purchase. Just after I left the store, I realized that it wasn't the first Godchild but rather the second, thinking that Jody S was the first. I thought I should go back and correct my error but didn't. After leaving the store, I decided I wanted a straw hat for the wedding so I decided to go into this other store and look for one. I accidentally went back into NTNS but hurried back out hoping they didn't see me. When I went into the other store, she had a pile of three or four straw hats on her counter. The straw was beige and the ribbons were black. I decided to buy one even though the ribbon was the wrong color. I left the store. Outside the store, I pulled the black ribbon off and decided that I could buy some pink ribbon so it would coordinate more with my outfit. After leaving the store, I realized I didn't pay her. I ran back and apologized profusely for my oversight. She was very kind about it. I left the store again and headed for my car. The stores were downtown. I was parked under some steel bridges or some such. As I was trying to get to my car I realized a bunch of people, like a large family, were in the way. They were standing along the street and doing something to a baby. Perhaps they were just changing a diaper. The baby had no other clothes on and was very large; not just like a large baby but very large. I'm not sure how to describe it. The baby also looked like it had something all over it that gave its skin a glazed appearance. Just as I approached them, they finished what they were doing and left. I got into my car and left also. As I was driving, I was going very fast, because I realized I was running late. I ran over a curb on my left side. It was the kind that divides two-way traffic. I had to drive strangely to get back over the curb and onto the road properly. I worried that I would ruin a tire doing this but I didn't. Other cars were headed straight at me and had to drive to miss me. I think I was still on the right side of the road. I had the sense that it was the fact that I was in such a hurry that was causing the problem not that I was in a wrong lane. A van pulled cross ways in front of me and then drove up into a grassy hill to avoid being hit and then back onto the road behind me. I had the sense that they had been trying to merge with traffic and pulled out to far without there being adequate room for them to pull out properly so they had to make this maneuver to avoid being hit by me. It was their inappropriate driving that caused their situation not mine. As I continued to drive, I was thinking how much I hate driving downtown because I hate driving this route. I suddenly realized I had missed my exit. Shortly after that, the road became train tracks and I was the only one there. Instead of driving a car my vehicle was suddenly a semi-tractor with a chain of trailers. Instead of driving it, however, I was pushing it. It was full size and I was normal size yet I was pushing it as though I was a child playing with a toy truck. I was still hurrying because I knew I was especially late now that I had missed my turn and ran into this unexpected obstacle. As I continued to push the truck, it started to go underneath a train. I'm not sure how that would be possible. This lends itself to this on-going oddity of sizes. I pulled the truck back out from under the train and lifted it onto the next set of tracks. I eventually came to a tollbooth. There were several lanes and all were full so I got in line. Most of the other trucks had the drivers inside them but I was still outside and behind of mine. As it became my turn at the tollbooth, I pushed my truck through. It went rolling down the hill and into the highway. It was a regular highway again now. I was still waiting for the tollbooth agent so I could pay my toll. I was trying to keep an eye on my truck so I knew where it headed. I was wondering if I would be able to catch it. I saw it take an exit ramp. It was in the middle of quite a bit of traffic and seemed to be doing just fine without a driver. You would think a capable driver were at the wheel. While I was waiting to pay the toll, I saw another driver outside of his truck in the same situation. His truck had gone ahead without him. He was dancing around at the tollbooth trying to get the agent to hurry so he could catch his truck as well. I don't know why, but at this point I felt reassured that I would be able to catch my truck.",

    "report":"I was on my way to the office and I was taking the route. I thought I was taking the route of K1 to 106th St. It seems that this is how this started. Then I was going up this road towards this path and I came up to an intersection. It was raining and there was something for me to step over as I crossed the intersection. I was thinking that I was looking for an intersection with a traffic light. I also remembered that I often miss that intersection and have to turn around and come back. That's what I did this time too. I turned around. I stepped off the path onto this farmer's property. As soon as the way was clear I got back on and headed back down. It seems as though when I stopped at the bottom of the path while I was talking to this man, there was somebody else behind me. He was also within earshot but I don't recall him participating in the conversation. The vehicle was like a sled but it has wheels instead of running blades. You can use it on any kind of surface or terrain. I was taking it for a ride, I guess is the best way to describe it. I went up this road and then go off onto a path that goes up a hill and then it leads into a park. From there I just picked it up and walked back to the car. When I was on my way to the path, I went to far and had to turn around and come back. When I turned around and came back, there was a fork or something and I took the wrong fork maybe. I was in this really wooded area. I was right along the edge. It was very narrow. There was hardly room to walk and I was on a kind of stone ledge. I could see the path just a few feet below me but too far to just jump off. I had to work my way backward to get back down on the road where I was supposed to be. Then I went back down to where I needed to be to go up the mountain path. I got to the bottom of the path. There was a man sitting there checking people in before they went up the hill. We were talking about exercise. I was talking about my blood pressure being so high and that being kind of dangerous. He warned there had just been a storm and that the path was rough right now. I thanked him for that. He was sitting there. I didn't want to get on my skateboard, for lack of a better description, where he could see me because I didn't want him to laugh or anything. I also had a blanket with me. Maybe I put the folded blanket on top of the sled to lay on. I started walking up this hill but it was so steep that I could hardly walk up. I would use my left foot to plan and then kind of pull my right foot up behind me. I had my left toes twisted towards the right, until I got out of sight from him. Then I was going to get on my skateboard, but the path. Some women came running down the path past me. The path was so full of leaves and branches and such that I had to keep walking. As I was walking I was using my hand to brush away the leaves and such off the path for anyone who came behind me. There was a tree trunk, a tree that had fallen. Instead of being across the path it was long the path the other way, leaving very little path to walk on. So I had to just keep walking. Then I came to a place there was a really big limb. I still couldn't ride. I had to keep walking. I got to a place where there was a big ball of plastic along the path attached to branches and stuff. I got it free and let it fall down the hill towards a house that was on the left at the bottom of the hill. I got past it. Right past that the path ended at a drop off. The drop off was very steep. The path was very narrow, almost had a point. Three sides around me dropped way down. I was really scared at that point. I was confused. I didn't know where to go. I couldn't believe that the storm had taken the path away. literally. It was a wide space between where I was and up ahead. There was no way you could even attempt to jump across. So I was looking around to try to decide what to do and was thinking about the situation. It was just unbelievable to me that this had happened. I turned around and I saw back and to my right some women were coming up towards the path that I was on. They were coming from a different direction. So I thought I would back down and then go off on the path where they were. But as I was backing down, there was so little path that I was very afraid of falling. I was looking for something to hold on to, to steady me. I reached for this branch with my left hand and then I was reaching for it with my right hand also and became very unbalanced. What I was reaching for wasn't there. The end of the branch that I was holding with my left hand just wasn't long enough to grab with my right hand too, but it was also pulling me forward a little bit.",

The humongous fat guy was lying in the sand on a tractor tire. He was (something) all the time. He had a girlfriend. She refused to wear clothes. She was fat too but not as humongous as him, and she floated in the creek on an inner tube. She had a seamless tan. The humongous guy slept on a rug in the sand; he was eating all the time and sweeping crumbs over. This took nearly all day. The very fat man jumped in the water. (dove) She (his plump girlfriend) didn't have any tan lines. I had gotten sunburned and there were seams (as if the sunburn had been sewn on). There were some white slivers of skin where the sunburn wasn't sewn on. The seams connected all over my body--up and down the fronts and backs of my legs. I was wearing a one piece swim suit. The attacker sneaked in. He gripped my arm like a boa constrictor. I couldn't move it. The blood would stop and I would be rendered helpless. The man had gotten me under the cliff below the horizon under the guise of taking my picture. He had a toy gun that would shoot plastic toys and baskets and pop like a pop gun. Then my friend Brian showed up and I communicated by facial expressions that the guy was trying to kill me. Brian shot him dead with a real bullet. Guys were sleeping everywhere in the sand. Every time the water would wash up they would sink into the sand a little bit more until they were completely covered. My cousin the model (who died of a heroin overdose March 14, 1998) was there. She asked me to curl her eyelashes. She had a fancy eyelash curler from Europe. I tried to use the curler like she asked me to, but it hurt. It was not good. I accidentally cut off her eyelashes and eyebrows, and the ones that were left stuck out in all cock-eyed directions. I ruined them and I told her I did not. She was very angry I had ruined her eyelashes and demanded we go to North Caroline to get them fixed. I had to ride in a van with all these model girls. And they were mad at me (because I had ruined my cousins eyelashes) It was the back of a van with couches and they were all very obsessed with looking perfect, but nothing else. There were multiple ethnicities of beautiful models. They were all angry. It was my war. One played a mean joke on me. A condom balloon on a string filled with air and confetti. Only one girl was nice. We discussed Chopin Preludes and Bach, Variations Goldberg. We discussed Chopin's Preludes #7, #22, #41. We discussed personalities of the individual.",

I had set my briefcase and purse and all sorts of things up on top of a car, and they started to drive away and I was on the car or in the car and I was telling them, stop, stop, and the people in the car too were telling the driver to stop.   My stuff was falling off and it all just kind of got lost all over the street, and she (the driver) started going toward New York really fast.  I made it back somehow to Sarah Lawrence and I stayed in a room in a part of campus I didn't know real well.  I started to look for my stuff.  My briefcase with the computer was gone, and I found in a stairwell in another building on campus my guitar picks, my metal finger picks, they had fallen out of my purse so I knew my purse was around somewhere but I couldn't find it.  And some other things from my purse were there too in the stairwell.  So I went back to that room I was staying in and I knew I was a squatter there.  There was really nowhere to sleep or shower or eat, and the reunion was over, everyone had left.  There was a little goodbye ceremony at the end, and it was OVER, and I was staying on after that although I knew I needed to leave.  So I decided to go find help, try to get my stuff back, maybe someone had found it.  I found an administrative person, and I recognized her, and I said I was here ten years ago, maybe you remember me, and I came to the reunion, and my stuff fell off the car, and it's all over.  There was something about finally asking for help that was significant, like I was trying to do this all alone, and I finally asked this woman older than me for help, and it felt good.  I don't know if I ever found all my stuff, but it felt like some saving at that point when I asked for help.  Also I think I dreamed about Richard B [my boss in the new lawyer job I took near L.A.], because I was thinking about him in the morning when I woke up, maybe something sexual.  Also I dreamed about having abortions, there were so many of them and the doctor or nurse or person helping me, instead of just bringing like one maxi pad in for the process or the bleeding, she brought a whole stack of what looked like blue jeans, and there was just going to be one after another after another after another abortions, and I just felt like I was going to have way way too many of them.",

    "report":"I was having a duel with some young teenage hood and apparently I was one myself. We both had pistols and I think a couple of kinds of pistols. One was a little 22 and the other one was something bigger - I don't know what. My pistol wouldn't work right. I knew that his would if he ever got a chance to fire it at me. He probably would kill me, but mine wouldn't work. As a matter of fact, I held it right up next to him and the bullets, I held it right up to his back and shot the whole 22, well the whole 6 shots, into his back and they only made these tiny little places and the bullet didn't go in. They just disappeared or something. Then it got very involved and complex because somebody had sent one of these pistols to the professor who teaches my Greek drama course. He was talking about it being some sort of strange Greek ritual, that there was a procession in which this should be carried. Of course, that's interesting because it would be a phallic symbol and he was talking about how the phallus is carried in, in my course. Anyway, he was talking about the procession in which this is going to be carried and I was afraid that I was going to be killed in the first place. I was afraid I was going to be arrested. I knew they were out looking for me, all these people were, so I went down off the road down the bank, this steep hill that was covered with quite a few trees. It wasn't real heavily wooded and there were stones sort of arranged like steps and down sort of forming a sign of the Z on the side of the hill. There was a shelter over the central part of it. A wooden shelter and I was going down under that and all these people were running around looking for me, but they didn't would have done anything like this, so they didn't stop me.",

Two girls drove up in a jeep and threatened the crowd that if they started any trouble, they would replace this jeep into a cannon. So they went to work on the jeep and up came two cannon barrels which they said they would use if we started anything. The crowd started to disperse. I stayed and then went to look at the cannons. They seemed to be made of wood. I bought a pair of underwear, long ones, and after I had them on for a while, they seemed to be tight. I said, \"I bought them large enough, but they won't stretch.\" I was working on the B and S and there seemed to be trouble. A fellow had a screwdriver with a round metal handle and it kept on rolling away from the job it was to be doing. Two of my machines were replaced with rebuilt ones or ones that had new, replaced parts. We were in St. Charles Church. I won a check prize and it was $10.00.

    "report":"I was walking around the city of the city where I live. I went into 8 or 10 different buildings. To enter each one I had to climb a steep, high flight of stairs. Each flight of steps was very unusual. Some of the flights either seemed to be or actually were built higher than the typical twelve inches. At first glance, at the first two or three flights, I was a bit hesitant, wondering about the safety and if I would be able to climb them without falling or getting hurt. At some of the buildings there was someone at the top watching and saying something to me about the steps, in some cases telling me to be careful or saying that they really aren't that bad if you're just careful. In most cases each of the steps was partially rounded and open. The best description I can think of is the shape of the end of a medicine capsule, only partial. The rounded end was there and the bottom extended a bit further than the top part. In some cases the rounded end faced out and I had to step over the rounded end and into each step. In other cases they faced the other way and I had to step into each one. In most cases each step seemed to protrude a bit over the step below making me feel that I needed to be extra cautious. At least some of them also seemed that each step was slanted. down towards the back of the step. It's as though I had to step into each step, sometimes over and into. The steps were also very colors, some with a marble appearance in dark colors, other were white. None of them looked like typical steps in materials or colors that you would typically see. The last building I entered the steps led down into the building, though they were equally unusual. This flight had more of a feel of climbing down a rung ladder, though it seemed more sturdy than that. I would typically feel a little nervous about climbing down a tall, steep, rung ladder but I felt pretty confident about this one. The steps were white and the entryway seemed very well lit, bright and welcoming. An employee of the store was standing at the bottom cautioning me. This was a business that people bought memberships to frequent. They offered all types of audios that people could come in and listen to, but the audios could not be taken from the premises. Each room had comfortable seating for patrons to sit and listen to the audios. It was made up of numerous average-size rooms. Each room had a different topic of audios. There was something unusual about these audios, though I'm having trouble putting my finger on exactly what it is. One thing is that weren't made in any kind of format that we're used to seeing, CD, cassette, LP album. As I looked at the displays I noticed there seemed to be two or three different formats. Some did look similar to an LP album. Others were smaller, thicker square packages, but not like a CD or cassette. The topics were primarily not ones that you would find on audio. I think some of them, maybe most of them, were educational in nature. maybe audio books. When I entered some of the rooms I knew immediately I didn't want to listen to anything from that category and quickly left the room, sometimes not going further than to peer in or step into the room to see what the topic was. A woman that I know was there, though I don't know her in waking life, with her child. I thinking a daughter. We talked a bit about this business. I told her I had not known about it before now and I just happened upon it. I came into the building just to see what was here. I was very interested and happy to have found it, but disappointed that I had not found it before. I thought that there were probably few people who knew it existed. It seems that there is also a man there that I know, again I don't know him in waking life. On and off, I'm talking to each of them at separate times. One of them tells me about the membership. There is a small, rectangular, window-like opening along one wall. The opening has glass, or plexiglas part way down from the top, leaving an opening between the bottom of the glass and the lower sill of the window opening. The lower sill has a dark brown, wood shelf, about 12 inches deep and maybe 1 inch thick. There is a male employee behind the window and uses the opening to talk to members and potential members, or to pass documents back and forth. I go to talk to him, to get more information about membership. He tells me what paperwork he needs from me to be able to complete the application and I as I go through my purse I realize I don't have the information with me that he needs. He suggests a temporary membership and that I can bring the other information with me the next time. I'm still not sure what the cost of the membership is or if I should be spending my money on it right now. I'm trying to decide if this is something that I just want or if it will really be helpful to me right now. Now I'm talking to Jane C. We're talking a bit about my whole CAS experience. It seems that she sees things more from my perspective than Bill C's. I feel that she is definitely sympathetic and supportive of me. She is getting ready to leave and I ask her to wait just a second and I will walk out with her. I want to continue talking with her. At first she hesitates because she is meeting someone outside. I tell her it will really only be a second so she decides to wait. We have to climb back up to leave the building. This time the entry\/exit seems darker than when I came in, though I don't think I noticed this in the dream itself. As we got outside Jane C began looking for her friend. At first she started to walk away thinking she would track her down but then she decided to stay for a bit. I'm facing many different streets, some running parallel to each other and others going off at angles in different directions. I can see down each street from where I am standing. I'm trying to remember where I parked my car, as I had been walking most of the day. I'm not sure I remember, and where I'm thinking it may be is quite far away and I'm feeling dismayed about having to walk that much further yet, to get to my car. The street running perpendicular to me is now somewhat rounded and has three or more lanes of traffic all heading in the same direction. heading to my right. The traffic becomes bumper to bumper just as the cars get in front of me. There are a couple of times that someone nearly gets rear-ended because someone is driving too fast and not paying attention. I realize that I need to cross this street to head towards my car and there is no crosswalk in sight. I'm standing there debating what to do. whether or not to try to cross this street in the midst of all this traffic. I see my brother Bob F drive up in a very funny, little, white vehicle. It's not a car really. It's something that he uses with his job at the park. At first I thought I could ask him to drive me to my car. Then I'm not sure I can get to him as he is in one of the middle lanes of traffic. I finally decide to at least get his attention. I call out to him two or three times before he hears me. He finally looks my way and I make a dash to his vehicle. As soon as I reach him I realize there isn't room for a second person, but he immediately pushes something behind him over and tells me to get on. It's a very small space. I would have to sit facing from the side of the vehicle with my legs dangling. I wasn't even sure I could fit in there. It was covered with some kind of delicate, pink fabric. There are some pearls similar lying on it or near it or under the fabric. I hesitate to sit. He needs to take off so I tell him I will just stand on the sideboard and hang on. The traffic is slow enough that I won't be in danger. So he takes off. There is now bumper-to-bumper traffic as far as I can see in every direction. There are also tons of people milling around. I realize that there is going to be a parade starting soon. I think I would enjoy watching it but contemplate trying to get to my car before it starts and watching it from there, rather than waiting until afterwards to walk all the way to my car. There are groups of young musicians standing around waiting to match in the parade. all dressed in bright, colorful uniforms. There are also a lot of buses parked everywhere. I suppose they transported the young musicians to the parade location. The buses have an almost graffiti like appearance to them. Most of them being a dark blue base paint with white graffiti. I'm trying to decide if it would be safe to walk between these parked buses, as the view from any one point would be so limited.",

So I carry on as though this was very normal, and I did not let on to her that she is dead. There is a very serious and thoughtful expression on Mary's face. I tell her about the trouble I am having with my shorts and she agrees to pin this up correctly. But firstly, she wants to know if we still have the two-tone black & silver flatware set. I tell her that I think we still have a couple of these sets in our garage and that I will go and look for them. Mary says she can get 10 dollars for each set from \"Cardinal's\" (?).

I have with me a yellow air tank that I just bought, and I've pulled the \"cap\" off of it by accident and it's bounced over to the other side. I'm going to go find it; a couple of men come in, one older, one younger but not very, and they take my seat. I figure I'll go tell them, at least get my tank back and they can stay there, but I'm putting it off for a minute while I (chat with somebody?)...I see the guy, the younger one, nearest the window, lift up the tank - they're talking about who left it there? and so on, and the guy throws it out the window. He thinks it's abandoned and it's in his way. I'm not positive that's what he's done, so I don't immediately jump on him, but I'm looking out the back window to see it. There's too much in the way. I can't see it yet, but then something yellow bounces into view. I'm extremely perturbed but not sure I want to confront this guy. After a few minutes I decide it's worth it, so I go tell him the tank was mine. He's sort of half-sorry (but only half - he's more amused at me). I tell him I paid $12 and something for it and I'd appreciate being reimbursed. He says he will and starts to reach in his pocket. We're getting near my stop, though, and I'm worried I'll miss it because he's taking so long. I've almost decided I'll have to give it up and get off because I have to make my appointment. But the bus stops, anyway, and we're all off now, in a large waiting room that looks like it used to be a high-school gym. We're all scattered around. I guess it's like a stagecoach rest stop or something, the journey's to continue soon. People are milling around, some in groups. I make my way over to the two men and ask for my money again. While I'm doing that, I'm noticing the door on the far side of the room, it goes to a hallway with offices coming off it, and the first one is my dentist's office. I also see a clock and discover that it's only just turned 7.00, the time of my appointment - I've made it, and I can be a couple of minutes late, he's probably not finished with the last patient. The guy still hasn't given me my money, though, and we're walking across the room toward the door, casually. At one place we stop and talk, but I'm very distracted by the exhibition next to me. A pretty girl with dark curly shoulder-length hair is on her back on the floor and she has clothes on, but her skirt is pulled up high enough to see her abdomen and somebody else is over her pushing on something - with her hands - very hard, hard enough to puff. I can't quite see what she's pushing on, though. It's a lot like CPR but not being done on the heart. There's someone else there, too, doing something, I guess, but maybe just watching. I saw them before, but it seemed then like it must be some form of exercise. Now I can see her face better and also pubic hair and by George I think it's some strange form of sex! I guess the others must not be taking any notice of it - nobody's told them to stop. The clock is now at 7.02, and the dentist and his nurse come out to say goodbye to the previous patient. Later, I'm back in my apartment when there's a knock on the door. It's daylight, so I go to the matchstick blinds and look out to see who's there. I'm pretty sure it's the man from the bus, and he's holding a \"Meerschaum\" pipe up to the window so I can see it. I recognize it and go to let him in - he must have decided he'd buy me a pipe instead of giving me the money. I'd mentioned in conversation that I liked them, but I really don't need one. I think he's a jerk anyway. When I open the door, he asks to come in and I reluctantly let him, but I won't close the door. I push something, a flat box, across the sill with my feet, and mention we have to watch to see the cat doesn't get out.",

    "report":"I was at Larry K and Sue K's house. I spent my time mostly with Sue K. I had such a great time I jokingly said that I thought I would move to their area so I could spend more evenings like this. They seemed to enjoy it as much as I did. Larry K told us that he had set Matthew up to spend the evening with a young lady, for the purpose of making out. He told Matthew to tell her up front what his intention was for the evening. I was standing behind him while he sat and worked at the computer. I saw him doing things that I didn't know how to do, in programs that I use all the time. I said that if I lived near them I could learn alot from him about computers. He was using alot of keyboard shortcuts that I wasn't aware of. There were four different kind of cakes. Matthew was there with the girl he had gone out with that evening, and one of her girlfriends was there. We were each eating one piece of each cake. We said we were doing a one night splurge. Matthew and I were getting ready to leave. We were driving a small-size pickup truck. We had bunch of things to put in the back to take home. We carried some things out to put in and pulled up a tarp to put the things under it. We both immediately noticed how dirty it was. I was hesitant to sit things down in there with it being so dirty. One of the things we were going to be carrying out to put in there was some laundry, though it was clean laundry. I suggested we take a few of the towels and lay them down and then we can sit everything else on the towels. Sue was sending some food home with us. There was fried chicken, French fries, and some of the cake that we were eating earlier. Alan K and Jean K showed up. Some of their children were at Larry K and Sue K's house. I jokingly said something about Alan K and Jean K's children were at Larry K and Sue K's house and vice versa. Jean told me that her and Alan had adopted a female child from another country. I don't know what country but the child was not Caucasian. The child kept morphing back and forth in age. Initially she wasn't even a toddler yet, then she was suddenly a pregnant teenager with significant nausea. Then she was a toddler. I am at the BE Retreat Center. There were quite a few people there for some type of class or program. Someone asked me about the SDI. There was a short flight of stairs, maybe just six or eight steps. I went up a few steps and then had to climb over a wrought-iron railing to get to wear the person was who asked me the question. A little ways in from the top of the steps there was a round coffee table piled with stuff. There was a magazine type basket with brochures and literature in it. People had piled stuff on top of it, maybe coats,  so you couldn't see it. A few people had made movements that led me to believe that they wanted to hear my answer also. I moved some of the things and grabbed a few of the brochures about the SDI. I handed a brochure to the woman who had asked about the SDI. Then I held the others out to offer some of the other people there. Three people actually moved close and sat down next to the first woman, to make sure they could hear well. I could tell that a few people were planning to listen from where they were and another one that didn't seem to have any interest at all. I started sharing my experience with the program and what a tremendous experience I thought it was. I gave them some of the technical information, like how often and when the class meets and other info like that. There was a couple sitting at a round table with a young child. They had another child that wasn't with them. They had been telling someone else there about an illness the other child had. Someone told them that condition could be much more serious than most people realize, even than most doctors realize. They gave an example of someone they knew. This person strongly recommended they take the child to see a specialist. Others had been listening to this conversation and someone recommended Doctor C. Someone else nodded their head yes. I'm not sure how, but someone knew that I used to work for SVH and asked me if I know Doctor C. I said that I do. The couple asked me where he practices and if he is part of SVH. I told them that he is part of SVH, and gave them his location. Then I also mentioned two of the young patients with this disease that he had cared for. I told them that he is considered one of the best and I certainly highly recommend him. The more this one person talked to them the more concerned they became about their child. I would even say this other person was really scaring them. They had become quite distraught. This couple decided to leave immediately. They were going to do something related to their sick child. Alan K and Jean K were going to go along with them and asked me to watch the toddler. They wanted to go see how they could help. Before they left someone said something about ice cream sounding really good. It was after dark, and most businesses were closed. Someone mentioned that there was something like an outdoor concession stand on the property and they thought they could get ice cream there. They stopped by the stand to see if they had ice cream before going to their car. They were asking the toddler what she wanted. I was putting the toddler to bed in one of the guest rooms. The bed was a little more than waist high to me. The bedding was yellow and white. I am walking through the second floor of the retreat center, and I'm carrying the toddler. It appears to be a very long building. There is no hallway. Each room is as wide as the building or as that wing of the building. The connecting wall of each two rooms didn't have doors but just a wide opening. I was walking to the room where I needed to exit the building to go to my car. Some of the rooms didn't have a front wall. There were very wide steps leading down to the sidewalk. I started toward the steps in one room and then realized that wasn't the right one, that I needed the very last one in the building. The person who was working in the concession stand was in a car and had an accident, hitting the man of the couple with the ill child. Alot of this seems to jump back and forth, as though the scenes of a movie had not been edited into the film in the right sequence. I was taking the toddler home to spend the night with me. I go through the same row of rooms more than once. No one can find the man who got hit since the accident happened. His wife is getting frantic. Alan K and Jean K get in their own vehicle and are going to try to find him.  ",

Nell [a good friend from undergraduate days, she was a mime] was there, in the lead as usual, sometimes performing.  The house had older darker furniture, some antiques, and low lighting.  Wood floors with rugs.  Later the house filled with water and when it was about 2 feet deep, I had sex with a man I liked there.  Earlier in the party I knew I liked him a great deal.  By then the other people were gone or elsewhere.  It was spontaneous, sensual, fun sex with him, in the water inside a house.  We enjoyed each other, looked in each other's faces.  It was unusual, but we were not worried about the water, although we did acknowledge that it was out of the ordinary for a house to fill with water.  We just saw it as fun, part of the party.  Afterward he went to the door to leave.  I had assumed from our fun that we would spend time together, or be together as a couple, but now I realized I was mistaken, my expectations had been too high, and didn't match his.  I was greatly saddened by this but did not want to show it.  As he was leaving, I remember hoping he had not given me a disease, since we'd fucked so spontaneously.  I had not thought about it before, because I had assumed we would be together as a couple so there would be a level of responsibility.  As soon as I woke up I knew the man was Rob, from his face, voice, eyes, body.

We had docked and someone was handing me furniture and other things to put on the ship. Without their knowledge, I was just throwing the things off the other side. This was good, because it would somehow protect us.",

I don't think I take that literally, but I do understand that there's a lot more to do after getting out of high school art classes. Then I'm in Mrs. Pappas's physics class, who actually looks very similar to Mrs. Wallace, and I'm doing a powerpoint or web page presentation on everything from baseball to dreams. The strange thing is that I didn't think I finished the page, but somebody seemed to have finished it for me. Although it wasn't exactly finished very well, it looked like it was possibly enough to get by. I remember talking and talking, and realizing I'd only started talking about the first subject so I decided to briefly mention every other subject in the remaining minute or so I had left. I didn't realize my mother was there watching the presentation, who comments about it to Mrs. Pappas afterwards. Then, I'm talking to Mrs. Jones, another teacher. It's a one on one conversation but all the kids seem to be watching intently. I had a bag with me and told her I wanted to get rid of all my notebooks. She started telling me how good they were for \"easy reference\" and everything like that, and I mentioned they're not all my notebooks (and I'm not throwing all of mine away) someone else had just given me a notebook to throw away for them. Then she asked me why I'm always acting so serious. Then I see Mr. Pons (who always seems serious, but is always using his dry humor to joke about everything). He says something, so I then shout out \"Pon-SON!!!\". I make another joke and then look for my bag, which I find is gone. Mrs. Jones had apparently taken it down to the office or something to donate it to some organization, but I needed some of the stuff in that bag that was still important and I rushed to find her. I saw a school secretary smoking, and wondered why the school was considered smoke-free if she was allowed to do that.",

    "report":"Dorothy S, her husband, and I buy a house together. We're beginning to move things. I was going through my kitchen things trying to determine what to keep and move with me and what to get rid of. I suggested to Dorothy S that since she cooks so, so much more than I do that I thought it would be best if she took care of moving things into the new kitchen. I wanted it to be comfortable for her since I do little in the kitchen. She agreed with that. I was going to get some linens and make the beds but then I realized that we had only moved one bed in, in a guest room, because we all still had at least one more night sleeping in ours at our old homes. My older and middle brother were both there helping, along with some other people. Bill F and I are someplace that looks kind of like a storage facility, but it is part of where I've been living. In one part of this building there are inside walls that do not go all the way to the ceiling but are connected with a horizontal surface. I had stored some of my things up there. Most of the things up there were filthy, dirty. Bill F was sitting on this surface at the corner where the two inner walls join. I was standing on a high rung of a wall ladder that went up the side of the shorter of the two inner walls. I was standing so my waist cleared the top of the ladder. A third person, I think it was Matthew, was walking around up there, bringing the things over to Bill F and I. I would decide whether to keep it or save it and then Bill F would act accordingly. Matthew brought me something that looked like a painting or a similar type of wall-hanging. The back was covered with a think layer of grey dust. Then he brought me another and this one was even worse. It was covered with not only the thick layer of grey dust but also large dust balls. Bill F knocked a couple of the dust balls off. Matthew and Bill F thought I would tell them to throw them both away because they were both so dirty. I told them I definitely wanted to save them as I really liked them and they had a lot of value to me.",

    "report":"I interview for a job as a secretary for this college professor who has a terrible reputation as a womanizer who \"feeds\" on the young college girls. I am a sophisticated, together woman in white high heels and a business suit. I am also beautiful and tailored. I step through a room that might have been an old gym room in PE filled with a jumble of boxes and crates. I get to his office, which is also crowded with furniture and so on. My desk area is in the far back of the room, to the left as I walk in the door and all his stuff is to the right of the door. But the door opens to the side of the room, so as I sit at my desk and see him at his, facing me at the other end of the room, the door is on my right. He says to me in a jeering tone that he has his ways and if I can't handle being around it, then I need to leave. I smile and say calmly, \"No problem.\" He hires me, now very curious about my calm and content demeanor. I do not disapprove of him or put him down, even though I don't believe what he is doing is right, but it is his life and I make no thought or attempt to try and change him. He feels that and is intrigued. I come to work the next day and clean my desk area. It is spotless, organized and ready for work in strong contrast to his area of cluttered furniture and so on. I sit, ready to work. He now wants to reform his ways and is falling in love with me and must earn my respect. I see two ugly rugs on his floor. He says, \"I want new rugs. Go buy me some.\" I laugh and say, \"Sure. What colors do you like?\" He says patterns or designs. I write this down with a marker pen on an old rug piece tacked to the wall. He loves this because it is so unconventional. He says, \"Maybe dandelions.\" I say, \"Cute and fuzzy, or botanical?\" He loves the way I banter matter-of- factly with him, not arguing or persuading him to anything I might prefer. I then go walking out to find the store. I come to the \"main street\" of the university area. A slick brick pattern is in the raised center of the road. I start to haul myself over the four-foot high raised area, throwing one leg over and scrambling, then I think, \"This isn't going to work,\" and walk an extra block out of my way to the stairs over it. I go into the store. It is a huge area with many cubicles or desks where beautiful merchandise sits. People go sit at the desk\/cubicle and admire different pieces as they decide to buy or not, lots of people. I see some exquisite glass vases and realize this is an auction or estate sale of very expensive material. I go to the back of the room to ask a clerk where are the carpets. He points off to a central area where I see bits of color. I then am distracted by other fine things to see. I decide I'll go see the carpets later. I brush against a cello case and it nearly falls. I catch it and put it back. Then I see what looks like tall, thin, fine, dark wood cabinets. I go to look, touching one that tumbles against the others, almost causing a chain reaction. The once thin case opens, as is a bass fiddle case. I get it all put back and am attracted to a revolving set of walls which have pillows hanging on them. I look and then move on to a table where there are books and cameras and so on. I pick up a fat book with a thick cellophane plastic cover. I see it is a working script book for a classic movie called \"My Dear ____\" (maybe wife). I am intrigued because I had chosen this movie to dissect to learn how to do a movie. The added attraction to the book is that there are special insider notes about how the \"real\" directors do it. I look at the price. $15.00 seems a lot. Then I see I got mixed up and that is the price of a book called Wizard of Oz. I then see the right price is $11.95. I decide it's worth it and take the book. Then I see a camera, a Lieka small portable. I turn it over and try to see the back. It says Polaroid. It was $132.00 dollars when new, but I can buy it for $12.00. I choose it too. Then I find an intriguing pottery piece. It is like a small compact vase to put food in like a snack tray. The beauty of it is that it unfolds so that the main vase part holds bread sticks and dip. The other petals fold out to create a trail of platters, each a different colored pottery to hold the veggies. It is adorable. I take it too. Later I take all this back to the office and show the man, who is now like Derek. He looks at the pottery piece and says, \"Well, you'll have trouble with Charla. She'll want to play with it all the time.\" I say, \"Oh well, I'll keep it anyway. I'll put it away when she comes to visit.\" He chuckles at me for getting so many things I like when sent on the mission of getting him a carpet. (which I also did get).",

Then I remember being in a mall, or a toy store of some sort, and there was this girl I knew sitting down and doing something to her hair. I sat down and threw a couple things that were on the table onto her hair. Then, realizing that wasn't exactly what she was trying to do, I cleaned her hair and made sure there was nothing left in it. She asked me if I wanted to get dressed up, and I said I wanted to wear really bright colors and look really crazy, sort of like a motley fool. Then I remember some computers, and a few other people and I were gathered around them. And the girl I was just with- we had been slow dancing without music (the music wasn't really needed). We just sat around, and I don't know what we did. Then she left. I thought she would be gone forever. I started dancing with someone else. Then I found her again, and I just pretended that the other girl didn't exist. I told her I thought I lost her, and I was so happy to find her again, and we started dancing again. The next thing I know, my parents are letting my brother drive me home, which wasn't the best idea. First, he doesn't have a license, and second, during the ride he stood up in the driver's seat, trying to look cool or something. Then, he slowly took his seat belt off like it was some kind of dance move. I was screaming at him to let me out of the car, but he wouldn't. I couldn't think of a way to stop the car without the possibility of getting us in an accident. The next thing I know, we're at home. I told my mother what my brother was doing, and she said he'd be in trouble but didn't appear very angry. Then I saw Clarissa, a girl I go to school with, who I took to be my ex-girlfriend (in this dream). I had a feeling she was upset with me for some reason, so I didn't try to talk to her. I felt bad she was feeling that way and I wanted to know why.",

He looked like he did as a young man, with a full head of blonde hair, trim build, and a youthful mischievous look in his eyes. Playing an old card game - \"I Hate You.\" I was so distracted that I didn't hear the directions and I wasn't sure I remembered how to play. My distraction continued and I never knew when it was my turn. We were all trying to sit in one large circle but there wasn't room for all of us so some were sitting a little bit behind others. Matthew is walking around the room on crutches. He had his right leg amputated. Different people ask him if he needs help. They clearly feel very badly that this has happened to him. But Matthew has a great attitude about it, as he most often does in life. Bruce W and I were talking. I asked him if he realized or remembered how much he used to tease me or how mean he was to me at times. He seemed not to, but I can't help but wonder if he just won't admit that he does. It seems through all of the events of this dream Bruce W and I are together. There seems to be some chemistry between us. Surely not romantic as we are cousins. I remember as a little girl I thought he was cute, but that's not so unusual. His daughter Lisa W and one of his sons are there. We went to Lowe's in his van. Other members of the family went also, but in their own vehicles. His two children were in the back seat and I was in the front passenger seat. We had purchased some lumber and things. On the way back he had made arrangements for Lisa W to ride with Aunt J and for his son to ride with someone else, telling them it was because the things we bought took up to much room in the van. It was really because he wanted to have a private conversation with me, or private time. We were chatting casually and exchanging occasional glances. For lack of a better word I would say the glances were mischievous. Whatever we were talking about had nothing to do with the glances. He reached over with his right hand and lightly patted and rubbed my left knee and rested it there for just a matter of seconds before withdrawing. This had nothing to do with our conversation either. Both it and the glances seemed instead to be communicating unspoken thoughts or feelings. Maybe the connection was just a personal one, of enjoying each other's company and understanding each other. Everyone at the house was talking about doing something. We were all looking at a computer screen. It was displaying a grid of squares and in each square was a graphic depicting some type of event or place we could go. Someone said something about the winery and the majority seemed to think that was a good idea. There were three printers connected to this one computer. Someone would click on one of the squares and then print something out. This happened more than once. Bruce W and I are riding alone together going to the winery. We are talking about his parents, Aunt J and Uncle A and how sad it is that they are both now deceased. Though earlier in the dream Aunt J was still alive. I know it must be very hard for him. It's very sad for me because they were my Godparents and very special to me. Even though Uncle A died 17 years ago, I still miss him and think of him often. I think we are all still grieving Aunt J's death as it has been less than a year. We start talking about my dreamwork. I must have said something about how few people understand it or are supportive of it. He immediately jumps to my defense and tells me that I shouldn't let what others think decide what I do. He also says something that makes me think he has been paying attention to his dreams and recognizes their value.",

And I was over there, I think, for lunch and their grandmother came into the room and said, \"Here, I would like to give you this.\" In my right hand I had a stylus and just before she gave me these things, it changed into a cigarette, and I had an ashtray in my hand too. I had to lay them down to receive these things. In my left hand she gave me the most gorgeous orchid I have ever seen. It was mounted on a great big, huge cellophane thing like a doily; it had a twisted stem and the top was all fluted, and placed in the center of this was this big orchid. In my right hand she gave me a thing like a floor lamp, only there was no base, but it had the pole, and underneath the shade instead of a lamp bulb, it was all flowers. I smelled both of these and I was very disappointed because they didn't smell (of course, orchids don't). And then I got ready to leave. I was going to some house on Melbourne. I started out by myself and I was going down the street carrying both of these, the orchid in my left hand and the thing in my right hand. The sidewalk was very rough.

    "report":"This episode takes place in our barn in my hometown. I entered barn to examine some rat traps (4 or 5) (spring traps) which were placed among a lot of loose wire, underneath a pig pen. The barn had been left unlocked and I rather expected the traps had been stolen. There was a large pig in the pen (evidently a sow), and from now on the rat traps fade far into the background. A trap door in the floor of the pig pen seemed to lead to a lower compartment where the rat traps were, and also where the sow's baby pigs were kept. Someone (probably Stone), asked if the pig (or any other animal below man) could comprehend spoken words, particularly \"they are outside,\" but it was the consensus of opinion that the pig would only understand by hearing the squeals of its young. The old sow was grunting. I held a long, slender iron rod, slightly hooked at one end, whose purpose was to pry up the trap door without entering the pen. It seemed to me I should be able to detect the presence of any rats in the traps by the odor of their dead bodies. The floor in the pig pen was filthy -- covered with manure and dirty, wet straw; in this muck were 2 kinds of insects, a roach, and other kind which I at first thought might be a giant louse (pig louse). This latter insect was yellowish-brown in color, about 15 mm long, and moved about with considerable speed. It had large, claw-like front legs which were directed straight forward, and reminded me of the front legs of a cicada. The front legs seemed to \"claw the air\" when the insect was in motion. The pig, though unusually quiet, would doubtless attack any one venturing into the pen. It was on the right side of the pen, and lying down, Many of the hairs, especially those towards posterior end of body, bore blackish, oblong, bead-like growths that seemed in some way associated with the filth on the floor.

    "report":"I had recently moved into this house and now I'm getting divorced and moving out again. I open drawers and pull out posters and papers. A poster I made has a face I drew of an old bearded man, Freud. \"Reviving Freud,\" it said. I see notes from college classes in PE, Health and Anatomy. I almost decide to keep them but decide not to. I'll never look at them again. I see some Library of Congress tapes in a closet. A woman friend says, \"I've already read them, or I'd take them back for you.\" I'm a little annoyed with her. A true friend would do me the favor even if it didn't give her something at the same time. I start to roller skate through the empty rooms. I go toward the back of the house and into the kitchen. I look out a window and see a small, black, old sports car, the new tenant's car. Then I feel uneasy and realize I should go look in the closet. The \"answers\" may be there, long ago forgotten. I hesitate and fearfully go open a closet door in the bedroom. I look and see a telephone, an old-fashioned wooden wall phone. Then I open my eyes wider and it changes to a sideways view of my night table, like I'd really forced my eyes open as I slept.",

    "report":"I was at the church. I was going to be doing a music concert in one week. I had to find some music for piano with hand bells and recruit some bell ringers. After my run, I stopped at the church and ran up to staircase beside the building and followed the Lindleys up the stairs. I know I could count on one of them to play. It was going to be a lot of practice before we played. I was walking without any pants on. I was wearing only a white t-shirt and it was just long enough fro me to hold it with both hands over my butt. I had to walk around the corner right past some construction workers. I found a pair of long silky black shorts. I had got a scholarship and I didn't know if I could schedule my classes. I had forgotten my chemistry book and I was looking for Mr. Brady. ???. It was very important. I saw Sarah Pratt in the school parking lot. She had gone away to have an abortion and the only school she could get into so late when she came back was Sarah Lawrence. She sat in a thick swamp with another girl and their school books--waiting for an over-the-hill past-his-prime country singer. On the way to his concert in a borrowed truck, we tried to remember as many of his songs as we could. When we got to the set, 2 homeless men and a homeless woman came in, showing him their feet--with only socks and asked for shoes. The girl crouched over to see and one of the homeless men picked her up. Then he picked up the other man. They were trying to show they deserved the money.",

    "report":"I had made a gingerbread cartoon for Dora and Rudy. I rolled it paper thin so when it cooked some huge thin pockets of air raised the base of the very, very thin gingerbread cartoon. The gingerbread was rolled as close to rectangular as I could get it on the metal cookie sheet. The gingerbread was rolled between 1\/32\" and 1\/64\". Very thin for cookies. The air pockets were 1\/8\" to 1\/2\" of air trapped between the metal pan and the thin gingerbread rolled out. The far right frame of the middle row (2nd and 3rd rows) had a picture of Ned Flanders on there I had made. He exclaimed, \"Who, me?\" I was excited to show Dora what I'd made for her and Rudy and to tell her who Ned Flanders was. We had to sit by the fountain and wait for the big flat cookies to cool and then we saw my father in line, real comfortable, with his arms folded across his chest. It was raining. Dora got a call over the intercom to unlock room #316 but she ignored it. She got called several times to unlock the door for this teacher of 316, but she knew the teacher was not sincere. So she politely ignored the repeated requests. She looked at the cookie cartoon with me and it started raining and I said, \"That's OK.\" I know you've got people to take care of ,\" and I went to see Rudy. Rudy was in the schoolroom checking out the (spelling) test results. He had a copy of the teachers' key. A guy had copied the teachers' key in her handwriting exactly, and in his own writing too. He made 100, twice, but he cheated... personality... personality... personality... Dora was showing me the infinite microorganisms in water, in the floaty moss growing on a submerged rock. So many microorganisms. So many macro organisms. Endless.",

    "report":"I had an appointment with Sister Toni. Before my appointment was over it was almost time for Mass. I told her I just had one other thing I would like to discuss with her briefly after Mass if possible. She said that was not a problem at all. We went to Mass in the chapel. Bryan N was there. I acted as though I didn't see him as I didn't want to interact with him in anyway. There are no kneelers in the chapel. When it came time in the Mass to kneel Bryan N sat down in his chair. When he saw the rest of us kneel on the floor he did the same. After Mass I stayed in the chapel waiting for him to leave, again so I wouldn't have to risk interacting with him in any way. I was getting impatient because he was waiting so long. He was the last one, besides me in the chapel. Sister Toni came in and he said something to her about meeting her somewhere to go someplace together. This made me very uncomfortable and a little bit upset, though I know I had no reason or right to be upset by this. It felt a bit as though she was taking sides or betraying me, which I know is ridiculous. I went back to her office to wait for her. Just outside her office she had a very small, enclosed, grassy area. I was looking out the window and noticed a path across the middle of the area that looked like it had been made by two tires very close together. The grass was completely gone and the dirt was slightly raised between the two tire tracks. It was only a few feet long so I thought this was very bizarre. There wasn't enough room for anything with tires to even be in there let alone wear such a path in the grass. Then I noticed something similar at one end of the area. I was going to ask her what happened to her grass. I sat and waited and saw her out in the main area doing something. She seemed to either be putting some things away from Mass or preparing for something else, maybe both. She finally saw me in my office and remembered that she had told me could talk a few more minutes after Mass. She said she would be right in. I kept waiting and waiting. I couldn't decided whether to keep waiting or to go ahead and leave. Most of the time I couldn't see her out there so I wasn't even sure she was still out there. I thought about just leaving a check on her desk but realized I wouldn't have another appointment scheduled then.",

    "report":"Wound up back on that first island. Things have digressed into chaos. This might have happened before the other things; I don't remember. There were people trying to take control. And there may have been foreign people, with much better technology, trying to take control of the island also. There were teams. My team was few in number, and not prepared. We didn't even know there would be such conflict. I made the best of the situation and acquired several weapons by theft or force from the other side. I wanted to resolve this without violence. My guns -- an assault rifle, sub machine gun, laser pistol and a .50 cal barrel -- looked intimidating. But I knew they were all very low on ammo. I had to use them to maximum effect. I told the bad guys, led by a witch like woman in a torn black dress and long black hair, that they should all back down -- I had firepower and could use it. I flashed the assault rifle, which shot laser type beams. She said she wasn't afraid and her people moved in. I said ok , that's it. I pulled out the big sniper rifle and began firing at them. I wanted to save the more affective assault rifle for when I might actually need it. I was hoping the much bigger and louder .50 cal sniper rifle would scare them off. It didn't. The bullets, white tracers showing the trajectory, zoomed all around them, under arms, between legs, over shoulders, as they ran toward me. They never did close, and I seemed to be getting away -- but then, from high above, more much more accurate shots rang out from a ledge high above. It was one of the more advanced people raining down bullets. I got out of the way and took cover behind a rock. There I found one of their advanced wet suits, which were the color of pink coral. I didn't know how it worked, but kept it for later. I tried to fire back with my pistol, but it was too inaccurate. I didn't know how to calibrate the scope on the big sniper rifle.",

    "report":"I am in the M City house. I am talking to Ellie and I suddenly remember that I have a pretty white cat with cocoa brown ears in a cage upstairs and I haven't remembered her for weeks. Perhaps she has died for lack of food and water. I feel horrible. I say to Ellie that usually my helpers fed her, but lately I haven't needed so much help and I just forgot about feeding the cat. I feel like a murderer. I go quickly upstairs and I'm suddenly surprised to remember that my parents had remodeled this upstairs bedroom area before they moved out and left the house to me. I go into the big bedroom and I'm surprised to see how changed it is and realize I've lived in the house for months and haven't even gone up here to look. Somehow, perhaps Ellie went up and got the cat or whatever, but now she is out of her cage and seems to be fine. Maybe her legs are a bit shaky from lack of exercise and the confinement of the cage. I am grateful she is alive. My other cats, a black fuzzy one and another white one, only with light brown paws and lower legs, are all playing together. I am happy they get along so well. Now, I look around the room. It's quite large, painted off-white and there's a fireplace on one wall. I try to remember what it looked like when I was a child and I lived there, thinking my bed used to be in that corner. I turn to the right and see the bed, a double bed, and two fireplaces and a gas stove-like thing in between. There are fires burning in them and I am again surprised and upset with myself. This has been untended for months. It could have burned the house down. I wonder how it kept going so well so long and decide they are gas fireplaces. I see a control box and try to read the instructions so I can turn off the fires. I wonder if I should let them continue to burn, because it must help heat up the house. I notice the ceiling, which is not finished. There are holes between the boards. This part of the remodel apparently never got finished. I see objects on the ceiling above the bed, and lay down to see what my parents wanted to see when they were lying down. An old musket rifle, another rifle, and a strange fox hunt horn like thing are on the ceiling. \"That's weird,\" I think. Then my father comes into the room and asks if I want the air adjusted. I say, \"Sure.\" He gets a stick (pole) and reaches up to a high shelf to manipulate something. I watch so I'll know how to do it. Then I see a mirror and see my mother reflected. She is painting a picture. I turn to see where she should have been from the reflected image, which would be the wall where the fireplaces are, only she's not there. I step closer to the mirror. This is really weird. She's in there, or maybe it's a window to another room, only now it's not my mother but some man painting. I turn back to look at the room and see several more people are there. I see my mother and suddenly with horror I realize it's not her, nor is that man my father. Aliens are there in human form. They start to surround me. I see a younger man coming closer. A woman is in front of me and they say, \"Your face is changed too.\" I now have a hand mirror and see with horror it is not my face. The lips are pointed, like Patricia's. I'd rather have my own face back. I liked it better. I strike the approaching woman with the hand mirror across her face and this hurts her. She stumbles back. The man approaches and I hit him. I realize I can hurt them and in the confusion I run for the stairs. I managed to get to the living room, with the man right behind me. He nearly has me and I keep hitting him with the mirror, using the handle to poke him in the groin as well. I dash outside to the street, cross the street, still hitting at the man and screaming, \"Help, help.\" Finally a bunch of cars and pickup trucks stop and people are getting out to help me. The man runs away. I realize I can't tell them the truth about what happened. They'll think I'm crazy and put me away. I also realize it's going to take some getting used to being this other person, with this other face. I wake up, hearing that cry for help, \"Help, help,\" still echoing in my mind.",

They show me a newspaper clipping from years ago about me and all the good works I am doing in the disabled community. Mark is gentle and sweet but somewhat distant. I tell him congratulations for getting the handicapped coordinator job at the community college and tell him I used to be that. I tell him he can call on me any time if he needs help or has questions. I do that to leave an opening so we could get together, if he wanted. Now I am at home. Mark and his sister and his cat come to visit. We all chat. Mark is shy, but seems to like me. I like him too. I hold his cat and the cat is loving and cuddles gently in my arms. It's as though I am holding him (Mark). This is a good sign. This means the cat, who is fussy, likes me a lot. This is important to Mark and his sister. Now they are leaving and I walk them out to the porch. Only now Mark is seated, semi laying down on a porch seat. I sit down near him and we talk. I look past him and see a huge river with lots of people playing and swimming. He asks me to describe the scene to him. I tell him it is a pleasant Sunday afternoon where people are all out to enjoy the wonderful weather and have fun. I tell him about four fat men who each stand ten feet apart and at a signal all fall in backwards into the river; the kids swimming and playing. A sled that looks like a snow sleigh goes by, with red painted trim. I describe that. A convertible car with no engine or hood in the front goes by, crawling over the couches near the bank. The driver is concerned that water is splashing into the empty place where the engine would be. He wants his spiffy car to stay spiffy. I say to him, \"I'm sorry,\" thinking I helped splash some water. Then I say to Mark, \"I'm always telling people I'm sorry.\" Mark and I are getting physically closer, our arms brushing each other. It is gentle and loving and shy. We are very attracted to each other. Mark tells me of his house, which is his but it's his mother's and his family is very important to him. Then I notice the river level is dropping. All of a sudden, the entire water contents of the river drain away and everyone falls to the bottom, including us. A man tells us that the water will be gone for one or two hours. I look up and see the man on a high balcony by a metal railing. The sun is warm and bright.

The way is rough, stones, debris and boulders. It makes walking hard, but I am managing well. I get back up near the house and Mark says, \"My brother left a taped message in your van for you.\" I laugh and say, \"Then let's go hear it.\" We go back toward the van.",

Then the boy came up to me with the husky fellow I dug out and he was now just a skinny boy. I saw Bob Lippert sitting on a bench with a husky man. Bob was fat and chubby and had his fat elbow in the husky man's neck, sort of making him sit in an awkward position. I pulled up on a big cable which made some freight cars move. I then pushed it back and they stopped. Then the cars started again and went down the track and up a grade. The last car started back down and I was on the track. I had a hard time getting off the track, but I did and the boxcar came by me and then it went off the track and climbed a steep hill, went to the top and started back down with speed.

    "report":"I was with some of my family and I went to visit my house on Lakeland Dr. There were priests living in it now. As I walked around, the floor plan wasn't the same as it was in waking life. But I recognized things and was enjoying going through it. I looked out the window and pointed out that they had replaced our deck with something else. The fence that they had put up was kind of gaudy. It had big, thick, black posts with horse heads on the top. It was shiny. I don't know what the material was. if it was painted wood or some kind of metal. I was looking for my refrigerator. I finally walked into one room and there were two of them and one was mine. I said to Mother there it is and we went and looked specifically at the ice and water dispenser. After we left the house I realized that I had not looked at the kitchen or family room. I am planning to open my own store. I don't know what kind of store. I asked BJ and someone else to help me make a sign. I was going to put an advertisement in the church bulletin and someplace else and I thought we could make a poster board sign that would look like a real sign and then take a picture of it for in the ad. I was thinking of the kind of wood sign that you would find hanging out from the building outside of a store. like in the movie chocolate. BJ complained at first but then agreed to help. It was going to be pink lettering on a white background. I'm not sure where we are working on this. At first I thought we had room to work on them in my parents bedroom. But we were in this very large room with several large tables. all of my CRHP sisters are there to help but we aren't at my parents house. I have a sense that we are back at the rectory but it doesn't seem at all like my house on Lakeland so I'm not sure where we were. I had started making the sign. My CRHP sisters decided what kind of signs to make without asking me and had them done really quickly. They had made one for each holiday. They used lots of different colors. They just used large white paper instead of poster board. And they got rid of my initial sign of white poster board with pink lettering. They didn't say much about why they did that. They knew that I noticed but they kind of ignored it. I know they were all there but the ones I specifically remember were Theresa Ay, Theresa S, Judy D, Linda B, and Sheila G. We talked about how to transport these to my home or store. They said we could crease them but it was better not to. If we were going to fold them over without creasing, we should fold them over with the print on the inside. They had lots of glitter on them also. They were pretty but reminded me of things children would have made. which was not what I had wanted at all. I had wanted something simulating a real sign. Some of us folded the signs over and carried them outside to put in a car to take to my home. Others just let them hang freely and carried them out. Some of them had tape on the ends as though to hang them. They had also brought with them these huge containers of cookies and sweet rolls and such. We talked a little about what kind of store I was going to open. I joked that I was going to be a chocolatier. But the more I said it the more I liked the idea. I still don't know what I was going to do. When we got done with the signs we had to do something with all of these cookies. We started dividing them up among us so we each had a selection of everything. Most of us were putting ours in these huge roasting pans the size that would be used to serve a very large party. Some of them didn't want to take very many and were putting theirs in small plastic containers. Every time I thought we were done I would fine 2-3 more pans or trays. People started leaving and there were still pans of cookies left. I think we finally ended up getting them all divided except one final pan of chocolate cookies with chocolate chips. I asked whom all the empty pans belonged to. Some of them were the tin foil pans but there were also plastic containers. Some of the plastic ones I recognized as my own. There were two plastic ones that had pull out drawers. In each drawer were two recipe boxes. I looked inside the recipe boxes and they were empty. As we were loading up our cars I mentioned that I was looking for a new place to live. Someone said this would be a good time for me to move closer to the northeast side of town since Matthew will be leaving for college. I said I agreed but then stated that I already live on the NE. I don't know why I was moving or if I was trying to buy a condo or house again or just moving into another apartment. Some of my CRHP sisters wanted to go look at it with me before I decided for sure. I said that was fine and that we would see when they were available and go then. I was asking Theresa Ay for sure. At first I thought they could meet me at work and we would go from there then I realized that was a lot of extra driving for them so I would just give them the address and directions and meet them there.",

He kept rubbing up against me and I kept get irritated. He got upset. I said, Oh, Darren, I'm just PMS'ing. He rolled over and then he brushed up against me again. This time I got really upset and said Darren, will you please quit touching me? So he got mad and got out of bed and was pacing around. He was saying that this just couldn't keep going like this. I was noticing that the room was really a mess because he was so messy. I finally got out of bed and said, you're right. This can't keep going like this. I knew this wasn't going to work. We just need to end this. We are at some kind of family gathering with his family. We are looking through some pictures. I don't think we had told them yet that we were going to divorce again, or divorce, I don't' know. We were looking at pictures. There were some pictures with me in them. There were some other people there besides just his family. I found some pictures in there of Shirley J when she was a baby and I started pulling those out and showing them to Shirley J and kind of detracting people's attention I guess is what I was trying to do. I finally pulled out a couple of pictures of me. I guess we were supposed to be picking out a couple of pictures of me for some reason. I pulled a couple out finally and passed them around. There was one that a couple of people said they really liked and I just shook my head no. I said I just hate pictures of my self. They said oh, people usually do, but these are really good. Matt O. was there. I can't get back what he was doing there. Shirley J was asking if Darren and I were both at her house with her open windows if we would be able to keep an eye out for someone looking in. I said, Shirley J, that would be next to impossible with all the windows you have in that house. She said, yeah, she knew it would be pretty difficult and she probably needed to think about getting something to cover the windows. We talked about that a little bit. About how expensive that would be to cover all those windows. And She has so many patio doors in that house. I said one thing you could do that would be really inexpensive is what I did in my office. I just used a sheet. She looked at me quizzically. I said I just folded the sheet in half lengthwise and used thumbtacks and put it up there. She said that must have been a really long window. I said the sheet hangs behind the desk so you can't see how long the sheet is. Besides, that would be a really easy thing to hem up. I said, the other thing you could do is a rod pocket. She didn't know what I meant by that. So I went to one window where she did have a curtain hanging. I said, just like this. Just take the rod like this and feed it through one end of the sheet and just hanging it that way. I said it would be a little more expensive because you would need to buy curtain rods. And you would still need the sheets. But it would look a little better than hanging it with thumbtacks. When I was pointing to the rod there was no curtain on it, just the rod. And either Daddy or Bill F or someone did something at the other end and made the rod come loose and then it wouldn't go back right. They weren't helping me to get it back right so I was trying to do it myself. I finally got it back. Darren came up and did something. The next thing I know there is this table and the rod had come all apart and there were all of these screws and pieces and the rod had fallen apart. I was so aggravated that someone had done that. We were going to put it back together. I said, first we have to separate all these out by size so we know what goes where.",

I asked for the whole can but she said no, so I went up to the refrigerator and got one myself. John Harrelson was at the table and he said he'd met a boy, 30 years old who was cross country skiing 12 miles to come see him. Across from me were 3 gay guys and 2 sharing one fold-up metal chair. Then I saw the boy in question riding down a huge steep hill on a dirt bike with dust flying behind him. We were on a train. There were 5 extra stops on the line to transfer from. On the 5th stop was a ladder of metal rungs going up a huge cave wall to transfer to another line. When I transferred there a time before, I hadn't seen the ladder and had climbed up a tree limb through a window. A park bench was in our front yard and 2 guys were sitting there drinking water. Ackerman and another guy. They were talking about tennis courts. The other guy said he would never make kids learn to play tennis because the sun would get in their eyes. I said you should learn to be able to play no matter where the sun is. They filled up their plastic water cups with the spray nozzle on the hose pipe I'd turned on the night before. My mother came and yelled at me about the wasted water. I got defensive and said Ackerman was drinking water too. She said she was gonna squirt water under the skin on the back of my arms and I'd have cancer if I didn't make an appointment like she said. I was trying on some blue jeans that had tiny, tiny patches of cloth the size of snake scales sewed on in a vertical pattern, ringing in very muted colors of greens, blues and purples. Like Joseph's coat of many colors. I didn't know if I loved the pants or just wanted plain Levi's. Aunt Linda said, \"If you keep running your butt will get smaller. You will look good and the town people will talk nice.\" There was a huge, huge pencil drawing--too dark--on the table in the basement of the church. It was huge overall but each individual section was the size of a fish scale. The drawing was underneath, but smudged over and I had to carefully blot it with an eraser to reveal a big, huge delicate drawing of Dora's face. On a tiny coin was a cartoon face I'd drawn of Dora as a little girl in first grade. I had drawn her hair very black.",

I was sleeping in their basement. One part of it was a large open room and other parts of it seemed to be like separate small rooms yet not separated by four walls and a door. The big open area was packed with miscellaneous furniture. It was hard to find room to walk around it. There also seemed to be several beds down there. They had me sleep in a bed that was near the bottom of the steps, but in this big open area. Donald K was going to be spending the night also and he was going to be sleeping that bed so they had to put me someplace else. Sandy K and Carol K were there also. They were going to be sleeping in one of the more separate areas. They found another area for me to sleep. I was thinking about cleaning up\/organizing that big open area. I didn't want to offend them. I just wanted to do it to be nice and helpful and I knew I could do it well. I didn't do it. I was thinking about the fact that I didn't know how they would feel about it. Bev was getting married. I was doing something and for some reason I realized I was running late for the wedding. There was a heated discussion about who was going to take a shower when and where. I think there were two separate shower\/toilet areas. The toilet seemed to have three walls around it. only enough room for the toilet, and yet with no door. When I went to use it I had my long ivory sweater jacket with me and I hung it from something in front of me. I turned it to act as a curtain so no one could see in. There was someone standing out there and I told them, or asked them, to help hold it so no one would see in. The bathtub\/showers had two walls and the shower curtains ran around the other two sides. There was some discussion about who was going to use the shower when. I agreed to wait until last. But, I was the maid of honor. Somehow I ended up running late. I looked at my watch and it was 11:45. I realized the wedding was going to start in one half-hour. I hadn't showered yet. I still had to shower, dress, and get to the church. I was very upset and panicked so I didn't even shower. I just grabbed my stuff and left. I don't remember who drove me. I think it was on the way there that I realized that there was something all over the left shoulder. It was covered in white candle wax. I was so angry with myself for not checking it earlier. I realized that I had worn it before I should have at least checked it, if not had it cleaned again. I was trying to crack and peel the dress off the dress. I didn't know if I could get it off. I didn't know how it would look. I realized at this point that I was late for the wedding and that they had postponed the start of the wedding because of me. I was so, so upset that I had done all this. Those things had not worked out better. I realized that part of it was my fault but I also felt that some of it had been out of my control. I knew that a lot of people were going to be very upset with me. I was very upset about that too. I was very upset about the whole thing.",

    "report":"In the first part of the dream I was walking down the street in back of the one we live on with my daughter. It wasn't exactly like the street I use in back of our house. At any rate, we walked down the street. On the left we came to a house that was empty. The people moved out of it. There was a woman standing in front of it. I just sort of ignored her and walked on into the house with my daughter because I had brought her down here so we could both take a shower and not mess up our own. Although this house was empty and the people moved out of it, there were still some curtains on the windows. I closed these curtains in this bathroom, which wasn't really a bathroom but a big square room with a rectangular recess in one part. The floor was covered with cement and it was just like a very big shower. Then I figured it out that I was going to get under this main shower and put my daughter in the rectangular cut-out place for her to have her shower. I don't remember that we exactly did take our shower, but anyway, as we were coming back, we passed a house that these friends of ours, a couple of years younger than us, had lived in, but had moved out of for the summer. They actually sublet the place, but in my dream it was empty except for some few things of theirs that were in it. We thought we'd go in and see if they had any mail or anything we might be able to take them. So we did. Now my husband was with me, but not our daughter. We looked around and saw some toys and things. We got involved in moving a whole lot of things around. We found a couple of letters for them. We started looking thru this Consumer's Union magazine and they had a report on toys. It was unusual for the CU magazine. It was in color. They were pretty vivid colors too, oranges, bright blues. Of course, all my dreams are in color, but these were somewhat more vivid than the usual colors of my dreams. At any rate, we see they're having a report on toys, like tricycles, and these cars that little children pedal and things like that. Then they said, \"We must really get up some sort of force behind us and do something about these Wright Bros., these manufacturers of toy airplanes for children.\" They told us that they are perfectly harmless, but they are very dangerous because it showed a picture of this airplane. It was roughly like these old airplanes. They said it had something like a half-ton motor in it and could climb up to 10,000 feet, and it could go for 2 miles. So it really would be dangerous. These people were trying to say that a 6 or 10-year-old child could handle the thing. So we read about that for a while and then some other vague things.",

    "report":"I was talking with Tony from Jake's Tavern. He was a graduate from a dairy college. He said he knew a fellow who took the course and it cost him $450. Then I was in the dairy. I lay by the different change processing and had a teaspoon. I was sipping up the milk and the flavor was getting better at each process. Mary Hugh, a schoolmate of mine in my youth, was walking by. I moved my head towards her and she brushed my hair with her legs as she walked by. A rowdy who was working the dairy offered the girls milk as samples, made her carry hers up a flight of stairs. I went up the stairs to the top and then started back down and she was still going up. I looked back and up and I noticed the rowdy and Mary were gone and a door to the right was open, the only place they could have gone. I had an idea, he pushed her in the small compartment thru the only door and did her dirt. I went on down into the dairy and a short while later Mary and the rowdy were coming into the dairy and she had tears in her eyes. He had forced her to his will. We were on a trip in PA. We were by Gotches and had a room to sleep for the night but changed our minds to start home by car. I looked into the bedroom and a strong breeze was blowing thru. Then we were by Grandma's and it was also in Rivertown. She made a nice ham. I looked at the thick slices right near me. It was lean, fried and red. I was walking to leave and I spotted Grandpa Evans walking between a couple fellows. He seemed to be spry and healthy. We had some money in a party that we threw. The amount was in the hundreds. I think the balance was to go to me if there was any and there seemed to be a nice balance.",

    "report":"I dreamed I was in New York and I was watching this man who was standing on the sidewalk selling some tiny poodles. They looked like poodles and that's what he was calling them, but they were about the size of Chihuahuas. A lady came along with a little poodle of her own and she said her poodle needed a companion, so she'd buy one and how much were they? $5. She thought that was pretty reasonable, so she'd take this particular one. Then the man put it into this paper sack with this leash and said that would be $7, $1 for the sack and $1 for the leash. She paid it. Her car was right across the street. It was a little green VW. Then they went over and she got in. I got in somehow and it was in the back seat. The man put the dog in the back seat. Then when he was getting out, he put it in a big pocket of his coat and walked back. I figured this was his racket. I told the lady what he had done. Then I ran down to this policeman who was standing on the corner and told him exactly what happened. The man had to give the dog back. Then something complicated happened because now my husband and I were here and we were doing something on the street for some reason. It was almost 5 in the afternoon. The policeman said we had better get out of here while we could because the 5 o'clock traffic jam was going to start in a few minutes. Right now we could make a but U-turn and go back the way we came and when the rush started, we wouldn't be able to turn around anywhere for about 20 miles. Somehow we didn't get turned around in time and then I was walking the way we would have gone. I understood why you couldn't turn because it was a tiny road. It was much too small for a car as far as that went. It was out along the bay and there was this overhanging cliff which was so low down that you could hardly even walk on the road. I was walking along the edge of the water. We walked along and went somewhere to meet some other people. It was rather pretty. There were trees and the grass was real green and there were various kinds of birds around. I just kept walking down this little road.",

Roth had a cheap casket, made of paperboard, and Bellow had a fine ebony one. I was to deliver the eulogies. Laura and I decided to put them outside because they were beginning to stink.

We stacked them on the porch, Bellow (who was tall) on the bottom and Roth (who'd been short) on the top, and covered them with a blue blanket to protect them from rain. The subjects of the eulogies were to be \"Seize the Day\" and \"The Ghost Writer\". I was rereading both of them late at night to think of something to say. We were laying in bed. This is when Laura noticed the corpses were stinking. We then moved Bellow off the kitchen table with his dark black wooden casket and Roth with his blue paperboard ex-musical instrument case (with metal reinforced corners) off the stool, and moved them out. Then we laid our own blankets back out. I thought I spied a spider in the blankets, but on inspection, it turned out to be some orange lint.

Several of us, I'm not sure if it was the entire group or not, were in a very large open room. I don't think there is any furniture in the room or anything like that. Along one of the side walls, a long wall, there is a drapery hanging from the ceiling about six feet into the room, not directly along the wall. It is there as a room partition of sorts and runs the entire length of the wall. We are all on the floor with a few feet between each of us, facing the curtain. We are on knees putting shoes into a compartment under the floor. We have been told that we can keep as many pair of shoes as we are able to fit into our compartment. This will be good for me because I am very good at maximizing space usage by the way I fit items into it. I quickly figure out the best way to place the shoes in the compartment so I can keep as many as possible. The floor is carpeted and there is no visible opening to the compartment. We had to feel for a soft spot in the carpet to identify where the opening was. Then we just had to push the shoes against the soft spot in the carpet until they went through into the compartment. We were able to reach our hand through as well to place the shoes the way we wanted them in the compartment. It didn't make a hole or any kind of opening in the carpet because each time we had to do the same thing again, just press against the soft spot in the carpet until they went through. For some reason it was more difficult some times than others. The best way I can describe it is how a ghost would be depicted walking through a wall.",

    "report":"I was traveling with a man I knew to an event. [unknown] It may have been the SAID conference or some other SAID event. We were going to be traveling by bus, which we had not done before. Since we had not traveled this way before they were a number of things we weren't sure about. We thought we knew where the bus station was. Someone else we knew had told us that we needed to check some of our luggage ahead of time so we had done that. When it was getting close to time to leave, I went to the bus station a little earlier than the person I was traveling with. When I arrived at the location where I thought I needed to be, someone there told me that I needed to go somewhere else just a few blocks further from where I was. I was somewhat concerned about the time so I rushed to get there and wondered if my acquaintance would find it and get there on time. I got there and found out I had plenty of time so I quit worrying about my acquaintance. Earlier I had to ask someone about the location of a bank or ATM machine because I wanted to get some cash before I left. I don't know why we wouldn't have known our way around since we were getting ready to leave to go to the event. When it was time to leave the event and come home, we had to go to the exact same bus station that we went to in order to get to the event. At the event, I was sharing a room with two other people, neither of them the acquaintance that I had traveled with. For some reason I question if they were both women. I'm sure one of them was. One of them I knew, but not that well. The other I did not know as well. The room we were staying in was a large open area. One wall and part of each perpendicular wall connecting to it were all lined with a banquette. My roommates had a daily habit of showering in the evening, while I take my showers in the morning, when I am preparing to start my day. One evening I decided to take a shower and they were concerned that I was going to interfere with their schedule, that I would be in the shower when the first of them was ready to take theirs. It turned out not to be a problem. The next evening I decided to take a shower in the evening again because we were leaving early the next morning and I didn't want to have to get up that much earlier. Again, they were concerned that I was going to interfere with their schedule. While I was in the shower, one of them came in with me and started taking her shower at the same time. It was an extraordinarily large shower, especially in length, but I still was not happy that she had come in with me. I don't like anyone else seeing me naked. I know some people don't mind it in certain situations, like at a gym in a locker room, but I do mind. It makes me very uncomfortable. There were two containers, for lack of a better description, attached to the wall of the shower. They were oval with one straight edge where they connected to the wall. Each had lid that was hinged on the back and lifted to open, much like a toilet. They where both white. One was for dirty laundry. I can't remember now what the other one was for. When I undressed to take my shower, I put my clothes in that container. As I was showering, I remembered that this facility offered free laundry service. I thought that I should have taken advantage of that so I wasn't taking so much dirty laundry home. It would have made it a little nicer for me when I got home and unpacked, to not have quite so much laundry to do. I decided that, after I finished my shower, I would go get alot of my dirty laundry and send it to the laundry service that night because I knew they would return it in the morning before it was time for me to leave. When I went to get it and came back, the clothes I had put in that laundry container earlier were gone. I told my roommate that I had forgotten that the container empties itself from the bottom at set times throughout the day and that the things I had put in there earlier were now gone. I was trying to decide if I was still going to send any of my other things to the laundry service. There were several other people in our room now, waiting for us as we were getting ready. They were sitting on one end of the banquette, in the corner. At the other end, one of my roommates had things sitting on it and was using both angles to get ready. It seems that we were getting ready to attend a final event that evening, but at the same time doing everything we could tonight so we could get ready to leave quickly in the morning. When I am traveling, I usually do as much of my packing as I can the night before. Two of the people who were waiting were Shirley J and Brad G. Someone, other than my roommates, said I could have Brad G help me with anything I needed. I appreciated the idea of having someone help, but was uncomfortable asking Brad G. I didn't believe that he would want to help. He especially wouldn't want to help me. I finally decided I should ask him anyway. When I did, he agreed to do whatever it was that I asked, but then it was Shirley J who actually got up, walked over, and helped. I handed her a pile of papers and said I needed them to be hole-punched and put in a three-ring binder. I handed her a three-ring binder that was folded open, though the rings were closed. It had some papers in it and pile of papers lying loosely in it. I told her those papers also needed to be hole-punched and that binder needed to be prepared. She sat down along the side of a table, with her right side to the table, to do this for me. A young woman I knew was going to be going on a trip and taking a bus for the first time. She was unsure of where to go and was somewhat ill at ease just from the unknowing of not having done it before. I told her what I had learned from my first bus travel experience, especially about the luggage and where she needed to go to catch the bus. I told her that someone had given me slightly wrong information about the location so I didn't want her to make the same mistake. I found out that her mother was going to be traveling with her, but arriving at the bus station later, similar to my acquaintance and myself when we went. When her mother arrived at the bus station, they found out that they had quite a long wait until their bus arrived. They decided to take their swimsuits out of their luggage and go for a swim while they were waiting. They weren't concerned that they would be getting on the bus with wet hair and no makeup. They were playing together in the pool as you might expect from two teenagers, having a great time. The mother was the actress Sally Fields. I couldn't help but notice what good physical condition her body was in and was very envious as she is about ten years older than I am. I was thinking that my body was in very good condition twenty-five years ago, but even then I wore a size eight. I was never as small as she is and my stomach was certainly never that flat, just like a model.",

    "report":"I was at Jennifer K's family's home. Her whole family was there, her parents, husband, children, brother and his family. I actually think I had spent the night there because I was going to go to Kings Island with them the next day. We got up and his parents had slept downstairs on some makeshift beds. I was getting dressed. I had black shorts and my salmon knit top. I questioned my choice of what I was going to wear that day but then decided that was very appropriate for the rides and such. I was helping fold blankets and such. There was one blanket that was, it reminded me of faux leather except that one side was very shiny red with a bit of a pattern to it and the other side was very soft. The whole thing was very thin, very lightweight. As I got ready to fold it Jennifer K walked up and said, let me show you how to do this one. She folded it so the leather side was towards the inside. She said, now you just wet this a little bit and it will stick together. Then it was also very smooth, with no wrinkles. It was also very small now that she folded it, even though she only folded it once. It was probably less than 12 x 12 inches. We were talking about various things when Jennifer K began talking about being a spiritual director. She was asking me some questions. Some of her family were there now. Rather than giving her direct answers I started asking her a few questions. I said something like, would you be able to not teach? Would you be able to not judge or be critical? She said she didn't think that was as problem. I said something to her about people in business, with business situations or decisions. I said something about the fact that she doesn't have much business experience, management experience. She was silent for a minute but then said she did. I said, Oh. Well. I guess then that wouldn't be a problem. But I've known Jennifer K for nearly 20 years and know that she doesn't have that business experience. I was thinking about that and thinking, I've known her for so long and I can't recall her getting this type of experience. But I didn't question it any further. It was a pretty serious conversation, not lighthearted and laughing as is typical for us. I don't know what time we were going to leave to go to Kings Island and don't know if we ever even discussed it. So as everyone was getting ready I just took off for a little while. I don't know if I was going to run errands or what my intention was. I went to NTNS, but in the dream in looked different. There was a glass door on the side of the store for customer use and there were a lot of glass windows on the side of the building as well as the front. I pulled into an angled parking space right in front of that side door. As I parked there seemed to be a dip in the parking space because my car rolled forward a bit after I had put it in park. It scared me for a second because I was afraid it was going to roll into the glass door. I put the car in gear and backed up enough so when I turned the engine off and put it in park again it would not roll forward, and it didn't. I'm back at the house and I went inside quickly. I had my purse and a box of something that had fallen out of purse. I picked it up quickly and as I was trying to get in back in my purse I said something to Jennifer K. I said, I'm sorry. I needed to run some errands quickly but I forgot to ask you what time you were all planning on leaving. I heard someone say ten til six this evening. I thought, Oh. They're not going until this evening? I didn't think that I wanted to hang around there all day but I also wondered if I even wanted to go along if they were going that late in the day. We would only have a few hours there, and in the evening, and I wasn't sure how much fun I would have, and lots of other stuff was going through my head. Then someone else, maybe a couple of people, said things that gave me the impression that they were just kidding.",

I've been visiting with some people and a man came - he's somebody we knew and like, but he's rather shy and retiring. Lives in the country, and I'm supposed to go visit him. He has to leave right away, and I'll follow on my motor scooter shortly. He tells me where he lives and how to get there - when I get to the town he'll meet me. He leaves, and I finish up, say goodbye to my friends, and putter off. Rouse is with me, and it's quite a challenge to hold on to her and drive. We leave the city and drive through suburbs, buildings getting smaller and farther apart, more and more green trees and grass. It's very pretty here - the road becomes a lane, winding through tall trees, little hills. It gets to be harder to hold Rouse - she's getting restless. part of me is observing, and wonders if I don't have any more luggage than this (there's a small bag somewhere on the scooter). I think of ways I could be carrying more, like a knapsack or a carrier. I begin to be concerned about how to get where I'm going. I think I stay on this road until I come to the town, but he mentioned 3 towns and I seem to have forgotten which one is the right one. I've been relying on my memory - nothing written down - and that's probably a mistake, now I'm having doubts. We keep on until we come to a place that has some people milling around - some event is going on - and I figure I can go and ask for some help. It turns out to be a dog show, or trials, and these people are rather upper-class, with expensive outdoors-y clothes, a woman wearing jodhpurs, all that. Having dogs around is also pretty tricky with Rouse here. (Part of me wonders why I don't have a carrier for her, and also, how can she be with me instead of in quarantine? - actually that's a little later, after I've left again.) The woman wants to help out but isn't really sure how, since she doesn't know the man I'm going to see and I don't have much information. The men (2 or 3 of them) aren't interested, and wander off. My brother (who's younger than me here) is in a side room of the house, a sort of den\/workroom, he's sitting on a couch and a couple of other guys are sitting nearby, one perched on a desk - he's older than my brother, sort of a mentor, and they're having a sort of heart-to-heart talk, very emotional for my brother, he's working through something. I come in and sit down next to him, just becoming aware of what's going on. I feel an empathy for him - I really am fond of him, though we're not usually affectionate - and put my hand up to pat his neck. I rub my hand on the back of his head - he's got a buzz cut, it's real short - and lean over close to him. He puts his arm around me and we hug. I'm pleased to be able to offer him support. I'm supposed to be getting married - I've got on a wedding dress and there are a number of people about, all dressed nice. We're outdoors, at a place where you travel from - either a marina or an airport. There's a plane or boat here, that I'm going to go away on, and I'm up on its top or hull, and it's in sunlight. Most of the others are in shade under the canopy\/roof. I'm climbing across the hull - there are clusters of ribbons with streamers decorating the top, in a row, sort of, and I'm collecting some of them. There are big bows, firmly attached, I'm leaving those, they're meant to stay, but I'm picking up smaller ones, that are just stuck down with Scotch tape.",

I can feel he really loves me and wants me. I seem to be drawn to him as well. We go into the room and he is showing me a special house he built that is earthquake proof. There is no roof and hardly any walls. I say, \"I guess about the only place you can live in a house like this is the Southwest.\" He agrees. I sigh. I guess I'll have to learn to want to live in the Southwest. We go outside the room and suddenly he kisses me. His big rounded chest is very prominent, and he has to bend forward to be able to get around the chest to kiss me. He starts taking off his jeans. I say, \"Please,\" I feel rushed. He is gently pushing me into the room. He lays down on the bed and asks me to take off my dress. He wants very badly to see my breasts. It is a passion for him that the breasts be the way he likes them. I feel embarrassed, rushed, and also feel his desperate, warm need. So I let him take the dress off as I sit on the bed with him. He pauses to say in a strangled voice of how terrible it is to be afflicted with such a strong need and not know why. I remember then, that he had told me his father had died in his arms, and right after that a large, buxom woman came into the room and comforted him. I realize this is why my breasts are so important to him. I say, \"What happens if my breasts aren't right?\" He says, \"Then I'll love you anyway.\" He then gently sucks on my breast like a baby. I kiss his arm gently. It is sexually exciting.",

    "report":"Bob F and I were babysitting Bev's children at her house. She only had two and they were both much younger than in waking life, and much closer in age. We took them somewhere in an SUV. It had gotten very quiet in the car so I asked where everyone was. Neither of the children answered. I turned around and didn't see either of them in the two seats behind us. It was dark so I reached back with my hand to see if I could feel them on the floor but they weren't there. I became panicked. Bob F turned the vehicle around and started slowly retracing our route while we watched outside to see if we could find them, thinking that they had maybe somehow gotten out of the vehicle. We were on a street in a subdivision and there were children everywhere trick or treating. We finally stopped the car, got out and opened the back of the SUV. There they were they were crouched down behind the back seat hiding from us. They thought it was funny until they realized how angry we were. I told them to never, ever do anything like that again. We took the Bob F was going to drive me home when they got back and then drive all the way back to his house, which would mean five or six hours driving time for him. Bev called about eight in the evening to say they were on their way home and asked if we wanted them to stop and get anything on their way. We said no, we were fine. She was concerned about Bob F staying awake doing all that driving, especially so late at night. I told her that he and I agreed we would stop along the way to get something if he started getting drowsy. When they arrived home Bev tried to get Rachel S to bed while we got ready to go but she said she only wanted me to put her to bed. I went back into the house and helped her get ready for bed. I got a peach-colored, lightweight nightgown that was very girly and pretty and had a matching robe. In the bathroom I got the nightgown on her, helped her put the robe on, and then walked her into her bedroom. She lay down on the floor under a hardback chair and immediately closed her eyes and fell asleep. I went back outside and told Bev she fell asleep almost immediately after she lay down. I commented that she does the same thing Bev used to do, sleeping on the floor all the time.",

She's living in this smashing house that's not in a residential area but, as if you were in a small town with a small downtown area, like it was near the middle of that, next to like doctors' offices and that. The house is modern, maybe with stone walls or something, very high ceilings, lots of plants hanging and standing, open spaces broken up by dividers. I let myself in to do what I came for and I also need to pee. The toilet is not in its own room but in the bedroom area, and it has an extra lever - I don't know what it's for, but I pull it just to see, thinking it might have a bidet function or something. What it does is let down this fine mist from above, right in front of you as you sit on the toilet. It's very nice but I still don't know what it's meant to accomplish. There's a cat here, too, a nice gray striped one, who comes up to visit. While I'm still sitting, Trisha comes home. I wonder if she'll be okay with me coming like this, but she doesn't mind. (She actually came in very quietly and I was startled when she appeared suddenly.) Her hair is different - she's let the tail loose and maybe gotten a permanent, it's falling to her shoulders, fluffier and curlier - very pretty - I hadn't realized that so much of her hair was braided into the tail. Also while I'm here, Lynnette comes in - we've seen her park her car and come to the house through the big plate glass windows. Trisha tells me she's changed her name.

    "report":"I was in this town but I don't know what for. I was trying to drive home. I wasn't sure how to get back. It was kind of like a city. As I was driving through the city streets it was mid to late afternoon. The children were just getting out of school and they were all walking in the lanes of the streets. This was accepted practice. The cars had to just follow slowly behind them. There was one group of children that had a teacher walking with them. On one street there was one child walking alone and I had to just drive slowly behind her. I finally turned into this one place. I was going to stop and ask for directions. As I turned it took me down a spiral, like the spiral ramp at the airport. It spiraled down, and down, and down. I finally got to the bottom. I got out of my car. There wasn't a parking lot. I don't know what happened to the car. I realized that I was at a mall. I saw these two figures. It looked like projections of people, but the outlines of the body were primarily surrounded by something that looked like Christmas lights but the figures were talking to people who were there visiting the mall. I just stood there for a minute. I wasn't sure where to go or what to do. I turned for a minute, I was going to talk to them and then I decided against it, that I didn't want to. I turned away and then one of the figures addressed me. So I finally said, I'm lost. I came in looking for directions to try to help me find my way back home. This one figure moved towards me and as she did she became a regular person. She said she would walk with me and show me how to get home. So, we walked to a couple of different areas and we finally walked to this elevator bay. Somebody came by and had what looked like a red sale tag, about 3 x 6 inches, with white lettering. It said something about CAS and BCB. She brought it along and she was rubbing it against something along the walls of the elevator bay. I said to this woman who was going to show me the way, She has our price tag. The woman I was with said, Oh, you know them? I said, That's the company I work for. She said, Really? Then the elevator opened and she stepped in and it started to close very quickly, before I could get in. So she grabbed the door and opened it and I stepped in but it was only wide enough for you to stand with your back against the wall and the door closed and maybe 3-4 people could have gotten in and stood that way inside the elevator. Anyway, as the elevator closed she said, So you work for Bill C? That tall handsome man? I chuckled and said, Yes. She said, do you spend much time with him? I said, well, yes. She said something about him doing training and I said yes he does alot of training and there was something about him using the whiteboard. I said, He loves to use the whiteboard. He uses it constantly. She said, Oh. So you stand there and watch him use the whiteboard. I thought this was very odd but said yes. She said, He's facing the whiteboard so you have a rear view of him all the time. I suddenly realized what she was getting at. She said, does he really have such a good body? Again I chuckled and just said something like, it's a nice view. I thought it was all kind of silly. The elevator finally started and it was very fast and it just seemed to go down, and down, and down. We finally got out of the elevator and got into another one and we did the same thing. We did this several times. As we were doing this I was starting to wonder if I was in a parallel universe. I don't know why I thought this. The elevators, the whole environment, was very odd looking. When I was in the mall it was like this huge open space and everything was white. I didn't actually see any stores. When we went to the elevator bays, they were like this huge white open space, with big white round pillars. The doors of the elevators reminded me of gold glitter. Instead of just flat doors, I wish I knew how to explain this, kind of like different levels to the door . I don't know how to explain it. We finally got off the elevator and there were two men there. She asked one of them to take me the rest of the way. So she left me with him. I don't know if we got back on the elevators or not. We finally left this building and walked back outside. At one place it looked maybe like there was snow on the ground but it wasn't cold or wet or anything. This one place there were different animals running around. One was maybe a bull. We stayed out of the way but we weren't afraid of him or anything. It's as though I am observing this man with another woman. They were almost buried under this white stuff. I'm having trouble describing what this is. I think he became infatuated with this woman. It seemed that he was someone who could easily cross over between the two worlds, the two universes or whatever it was. And she wasn't. And he was bringing her into this universe, I guess, where I live in waking life. One or two times he picked her up and carried her. Somebody else said something to him about how to treat her if he really wanted to get her to fall for him.",

They look scary and intimidating. As I watch, I realize they are escaping and coming out towards us to cause us harm. I begin to move rapidly toward the exit. Ginny and I and the young man run downstairs and out the door. The man is insistent in his love for me. Ginny goes to a car and I follow her. She says, \"I want to get away alone for a while. I'm going to take off and I'll see you later.\" I sort of realize she is giving me and the man time to be alone together. She goes and now the man and I have spent a day or two as lovers. But I am married and on Tuesday I leave to go home. He is desperate to keep me. He follows me and says, \"I hate Tuesday. I hate Monday because it is next to Tuesday. Please don't leave me.\" I am very attracted to him, but insist I must go. He is much younger than I, and I have my family to return to and I can't really believe this is a good thing to do because of our age difference. He tries and tries to convince me his love is real and forever, not a youthful whim or a passing fancy or lust. I don't let myself trust that and resist. In despair he walks away from me back into the animal exhibit building. I realize he is in bad danger and I rush in to distract and I yell something which alerts him. I had put myself in danger to save him. I turn and run out, and he escapes and runs out. Again he renews his pleas. I still say no. I am walking down the road and see a pile on beautiful conch. I pick one up and want more and then see pottery plates and bowls and realize a Native American person is selling their wares here. The man follows me. He says to me, \"OK, if tell you I am rich, will that convince you to stay?\" I say, \"No, it wouldn't.\" I walk away. The man says with intense emotion to the Native American man, \"Oh, I so want a Porsche to stop and pick me up.\" He means that I am driving a Porsche and he wants me to come back and accept him. The Native American man looks at me and says to the man, \"I can't see what you see in her, but if that's what you want, then fine.\" Now he goes up a high cliff at the ocean's edge. I climb up to follow him, fearing he will jump or something, but as I reach him and he hugs me, I am the one that falls. He rushes down to where I lay, encircled with barbed wire that is black. I have been injured. He calls the medics and the doctor says, \"She'll be wrinkled and weaker or something but she'll be OK.\" The doctor suggests we call the police. While we wait for the police to arrive, I ask him what the doctor said. He says, \"The doctor says you'll be wrinkled and this and that, but I don't care. I still love you and always will.\" Now it is Tuesday and he's crying and begging me that his life will be empty and sad if I leave him. I feel tremendous push-pull, but still can't quite believe or trust he is authentic and sure. This will all pass for him soon. I leave, but I go home and divorce my husband, realizing that I don't love him. Months pass and I must try and reach him. He had given me his phone and address and every conceivable number he could be reached at. (NOTE: At this point, I think I wake up and finish the dream awake.) I go to his rich parents' large home and ask for him. He isn't there, but has an apartment in the city. The father sees me and realizes I'm the woman who his son loves and wants and says things like, \"Whatever will make my son be happy and alive again, I want him to have.\" I go to the apartment to find him. He is with a young woman his age. I am carrying a stuffed monkey with a heart in his hands. I leave it at the door and don't even knock, but the man somehow senses me and opens the door just as the elevator door across the hall is shutting. He yells at me, \"No, come back, please.\" He runs down the stairs and is there when the elevator door opens. He begs me to return. The girl means nothing. He was trying to get on with his life without me, but it wasn't working. He would give anything to just pick me up and take me to the apartment and hold on to me forever, but he knows I must come because I want to. He says, \"If only you could come knock on the door and say to me, 'My dearest one, I love you and want to marry you forever.'\" He walks away from me, leaving me to decide. He returns to the apartment. I then go up, knock on the door and say that sentence. We hug and live happily ever after.",

    "report":"I am in bed next to Merle and we sweetly hold hands and talk like friends. I get up to get ready to go to the beach with Ellie. I'm choosing what to wear. Later I am standing in a bookstore in France, and a man stands near me. I really like him and it is mutual. We are like lovers before we really become lovers, that warm beginning of a love relationship. We look into each others' eyes and smile. He shows me where the small section of books in English are. We are in the political (said in French) section of the store. I say, \"I'll be curious to know what they consider political.\" I laugh at the book I look at. \"This is political??\" We stroll on down the aisle. He and his business partner are going to buy this place. I look around and say, \"We could rent out these spaces and people could build gardens and we could gain from their labor.\" It all seems fair and equitable. We provide the space and they pay a rent. We go into another room. I ask where the freezer room is. He points it out to me. I look in. It is empty and cold as a freezer room should be. I am pleased. I say, \"They can buy a half a beef from us and pay us to cut it and wrap it and freeze it here.\" I see stairs and we walk up to the second floor. It is only partly done, partitions marked on the floor where the previous owner wanted to build. He's run out of money and declared bankruptcy. That's why we can move in and buy a good bargain so well. Our money and energy will finish the project. I feel a bit sad for him, but maybe he can join with us in some way to be a part of this project. The other man asks, as I am saying I'll do this and that with the space, \"Well, what about us? What will we get?\" I say, \"Anything you want. Name it -- what spaces --  and they are yours.\" It is a pleasant relationship.",

    "report":"I was in a very unusual two-story home. One end of the home is attached to the owner's retail store. The home was owned by a couple with two young adult children. The woman had asked me to talk to a decorator about some changes she wanted made to the home, including structural changes. I am talking to the decorator about creating a very nice master suite with a luxurious master bath. I specified a whirlpool tub and for the shower I specified a bench seat and making it a steam shower. I wondered about talking to him about a sauna but decided against it, thinking that what I had already specified would be sufficient. They also wanted to expand their garage. I walked him out to the garage, which was one-car only. It was completely empty. I told him that all four members of the family have their own car. The outer wall of the garage is the wall that was attached to the retail store so I didn't know how he would be able to expand it to house more than one car. The owners had not specified if they wanted it to house just one additional car or all four cars. The son had several friends spending the night. His bedroom is on the first floor. The daughter's bedroom in on the second floor but it is only accessible via a ladder and by going up this ladder you can only access her bedroom. The room ran the full width of the house though it was no wider than an average bedroom. There was a bed on each end. She had one friend spending the night and I was spending the night. The parents had decided I would sleep in the daughter's room. I could tell she was not too pleased about this. To try to make it easier I told her I would just sleep on the floor in the middle of the room. The son and his friends are in there watching TV but are also planning to sleep in there. The son has never kissed a girl before and he wants me to teach him how. I keep telling him that I can't do that but he tries once anyway. There is a square opening in the wall that is barely big enough for a person to fit through. It is an opening for a rectangular area with a diameter no bigger than the square opening. I crawl in there and lie down on my back intending to sleep in there away from the others. The son crawls in and I tell him he needs to get out. He tries again to kiss me. Then one of his friends crawls in. They finally both get out. The daughter's friend tells the parents that I am making out with the boys. I defend myself and tell them that it is not true, though I don't tell them what their son did. They don't believe me. The daughter has left the house because she was very upset about something unrelated. As soon as the parents hear that she is gone they panic and decide they are going out to try to find her. The son and I are going along. We are rushing around to find shoes and coats so we can leave. The son goes out on his own and comes back to tell his parents that he found her and she is dead. He found her floating on her back in the water behind the house. We all go out. It is dark out so we can barely see where we are walking. It is a steep hill so we lean back to try to keep our balance as we make our way down the steep embankment. We get to the bottom and the son shines a flashlight on his sisters' body. It hardly looks like her. She looks like she has been out there for a long time instead of a just a few hours. I only look for a few seconds because it is so disturbing. The inside of the house, the walls, the floors, the ceiling, is constructed with unfinished wood. The stairways are very unusual or are ladders. There is a pole that the boys use to go downstairs, sliding down as though it were a fireman's pole. There is a man there that I need to leave as soon as possible so they don't try to involve me in any of the drama. I follow him to get out and away. I'm now on a boat with this man, Frank B from Trading Spaces. There is still a problem. He realizes that we just need to get off of this boat. We create another kind of boat out of unfinished wood and poles. There are quite a few of us that get on and go off on our own. It has two levels but there are several sections on each level. As we're floating along the water, at times there is low hanging foliage that brushes the top of the boat, almost coming inside at times. We see things that we can eat. Since we have no food on the boat we start pulling these off the branches as we continue to move. We can't stop the boat. We don't know what some of the things are but we take them anyway. We also see bananas. As soon as we see those we begin grabbing those quickly so we can get as many as possible even though we know we shouldn't eat more than one day for good colon health. Someone in another section had seen and grabbed a bunch of strawberries. We're taking turns steering the boat. Someone tells me that it's time for me to take a break and get some rest. I climb up on a platform that is just big enough to lie down on. It is held in place by a wooden pole on each corner that is fairly small in diameter, maybe only 3 or 4 inches. But the platform seemed very sturdy. There was something laying on the platform and I just lay on top of it. As I was laying there I kept reaching for this stuff to make sure it didn't fall off. Frank was either sitting or laying on a platform underneath me. Someone said something to me that caused me to be concerned about his well-being. We were on this thing for quite some time. Frank and I became quite close and ended up getting married. We are in danger from someone that wasn't on either boat. We had to be very careful to keep everyone on the boat safe from the people on shore. Some of the people on the boat also became a threat. We had to be especially careful not to go in the sections of the boat where these people are. One person in the dangerous group knew me and Frank and didn't want to see us get hurt so he helped us to stay together and safe. Some of us had gotten off the boat and were in the water. I had several six-inch square pieces of paper with notes on them from Jennifer F. They were notes for her boyfriend. I was worried that they were going to get wet. I managed to get them in a plastic container that was almost exactly the same size as the papers. He was one of the people on the shore that we were in danger of. Yet, because he knew me, he was not doing anything to harm any of us. He essentially pretended not to see us.",

Then I say to him, \"Well, you should talk. Look at your lips, all thick.\" We do this back and forth for a while. Now I am running on a track. There is a cluster of uniformed track women running ahead. I, the dreamer, watch them pass and I look way beyond them down the track and see me dead last.

I open them, and notice my roommate has already opened some and put the tiger lily flowers up in a hanging plant thing. It looks pretty, but I wish she'd waited for Charla.

I look around for something that will work and see a small little flat board and think it will do, and then I go to other classrooms to see what's around. I find a larger, more fancy thing that would hang from their neck and the sheet music would be facing the audience and I wonder how they would read the music, even though it looks pretty for the audience. Then I see a photography class and listen in and realize they really want it to be spiffy and entertaining. So now I find a long, ornate board and we'll do some precision moves and wear costumes. I go into another room and as I'm going down the street in my wheelchair, I see another woman in a wheelchair, a larger woman like Rudean. We travel together for a block or so, bumping over curb cuts and ducking cars. She seems negative. I go into a class, two narrow rows of desks and everyone hurriedly gets up to make room for me. I feel conspicuous, but this is normal. They aren't used to the chair. We get settled in and they are talking about doing a dance and can't imagine how I can participate. I point out to them that I already know how to dance and ask Archie to dance with me to show them. He does some warm up moves and I do too with my chair and spin around and skid to a stop and everyone is impressed and amazed. They and I shove the rugs and furniture aside to make room and then Archie and I dance. It is lovely. At one point he pulls me up to standing and we dance. I then lean into the instructor and incorporate him into the dance. They start relaxing around me. Now another woman is going to share her dance and needs to cast the dancers. She says angrily and sadly that suicide is the end. I say, \"Maybe, maybe not. If the person doesn't learn from it, they die and that's sad, but if they learn and grow from it, it is beautiful. It's a pivotal decision point, a challenge, and therefore powerful and beautiful.\" Now she instructs us to stand in our places. We form a sort of short square cross. She is skinny and has a skinny young boyfriend, dance partner. Other skinny young women are in her dance team.

He then shows me an ordinary smoking pipe and says if this is handed to me, I must hold it in my cupped hands just as he shows me, or I will offend the gods. I agree and watch carefully. I ask how I should return it after I have taken a smoke. He says, \"Turn it this way (full circle, clockwise) and hand the pipe stem first.\" I listen carefully and nod. The ceremony begins. [BL]",

I'm with some other people but I'm pretty distracted by him. I think he's with other people too but not with a girl.

    "report":"I was in my apartment with Mother and some other members of my family that I cannot identify. It was not my waking life apartment. Something had happened that I realized this was a perfect opportunity to make some major furnishing changes in my apartment. I was going to switch the living room with the dining room for one thing. Currently in the dream home, the front door led directly into the dining room. Matthew had already hung curtains so I realized they were going to need to be switched as well. Matthew had arrived home from a visit with his Dad and the apartment was filled to capacity, little floor space left, with old furniture. I found out that Grandma and Grandpa Ho had intended to get rid of all this stuff and Matthew thought I might want some of it because of my interest in antiques and old furniture. So they sent it all with him, with the instructions for me to do whatever with the things I didn't want. There was a lot I didn't want and obviously didn't have room for all of it either. I still wanted to make the switch of the two rooms but now could not even find my original furnishings. At this point there were many other people there, most that I didn't know, and some were Harris family members. I believe BJ and Bev might have been there also. Everyone pitched in and began helping me to clear the place out by eliminating the items I didn't want. Now the apartment had a basement garage so we were taking these things through the stairwell into that space. Bob F was one of the men down there taking things from the people working upstairs. At some point I realized that a lot of the people who were helping were from a not-for-profit group and I was going to donate all of the things I didn't want to them. It almost felt as if things were multiplying because I kept finding more and more stuff that I hadn't realized was there before. There were several old sofas and big easy chairs. There were quite a few huge wood pieces, such as wall units, or bookshelf kind of things. Many of these were hideous looking in my opinion. They were very large, heavy and difficult to move. We were alternating our positions and jobs in clearing the place out. Some people wanted turns being at the top of the stairs. I mostly stood between the various rooms and the top of the stairs and kept pushing things toward the person at the top of the stairs. I would occasionally put things into the stair well myself. Sometimes just sitting things on the first landing and sometimes handing things down to men in the basement\/garage. The stairwell had a few steps to the first landing, then turned left and went the rest of the way down. I had taken something with two legs that I thought was very light and not dangerous and just kind of pushed it down. I realized after I let go that one of the legs hit someone in the head. Instead of saying anything I walked away. As I did so I knew I should go back and acknowledge what I did and apologize but I was too embarrassed and for some reason afraid to. Then I heard people talking loudly and criticizing what had happened. The man was bleeding but I don't know how badly. Someone thought he might need stitches but most thought that person was overreacting. I never did go and admit what I had done. This was taking much longer than people had thought it would. Many of us were beginning to get hungry. I went and asked Daddy if I should order dinner to be delivered. I don't remember him answering me then but I didn't do it. At the time I thought I didn't need his permission to do that if I'm going to pay for it myself. Maybe I thought if I asked him he would offer to pay. In waking life I know he would. For whatever reason we didn't order dinner and we kept working. The Harris family members that were there had been there for another reason and had not expected to stay so long. Even when they decided to stay and help with this new situation they didn't realize it would take so long. I don't think any of us did. They were particularly hungry. I kept thinking about how Darren and Matthew got all of this stuff here and how I could have been unaware of them bringing all of this stuff into the apartment when it had to have taken them a good deal of time. BJ and Bev kept identifying items that they thought I would want to keep. One of them found a beautiful bedroom suit. It was white with a pastel flower design\/fabric on parts of it. I said that I absolutely wanted to keep that. In waking life I have wanted a new bedroom suit for almost 20 years, but can never seem to afford it. They and we found quite a few really great furniture items, artwork, two really great desks. one that I would keep in the kitchen and one for my office, other decorative items. Some of the artwork seemed very contemporary and colorful. In fact, there was an artist there painting a piece similar to several that were already there. I felt bad that he saw me deciding to give them away. I kind of liked them but not enough to keep them in light of everything I had there. At some point the scene shifted and we were still in the same apartment but it now seemed as though we were clearing out the remnants of someone who used to live there for us to move in. There were things hanging on the walls that needed to be removed. Some things I would decide to keep and either not remove or rehang after thinking about it. In the kitchen there were cabinets full of white\/see-through plastic containers and I gave away the containers and everything. There were also quite a few small wooden cabinets for lack of a better word, that had lots of little compartments and such. They were each made to house certain types of items. I had removed one from the wall, examined it carefully, and then replaced it deciding to keep it. I then decided to keep all of the similar ones. There were also two or more refrigerators. They had containers in them but no food. I gave away all but one of them, containers and all. The one I kept seemed to fit nicely into a kitchen cove. It was smaller than a conventional home refrigerator and it was brown. As we continued to clear things out I decided to put all of the artwork in one place together and I would not go through it until after I had the furniture I wanted and placed where I wanted it. Then I could better decide which artwork I wanted to keep and had the space to hang. There was a lot of artwork and I really liked most of it. We continued to try to find the living room and dining room pieces that I wanted to keep and get them placed where I wanted them. I wanted to gather the pieces into the appropriate room and then have Mother help me decided where to place things for the best aesthetic results. For some reason I was focusing on completing the dining room first, but was definitely focused on the living room second. we thought we were almost done and then realized that my bedroom was still full so we began working on it. Then we thought we were almost done and we realized the kitchen was still full. In working on emptying the kitchen I noticed all of the things hanging on the walls that needed to be removed. I removed some of them but asked others to help with that. I went into the bedroom and began selectively taking things off the walls. I kept the religious items that were there and some of the lighting fixtures\/lamps. The only thing in particular that I remember hanging in the kitchen, though I remember there were a lot of things hanging, is a small yarn thing that reminded me of a miniature flower holder that was popular maybe twenty years ago. People were beginning to complain more and more about how hungry they were. I finally decided to go ahead and order pizza. One man pulled a bunch of pizza coupons out of his pocket. They offered two medium pizzas for $9.99. I asked someone to call in an order and just order a variety of different kinds. There were a lot of people there so they needed to figure out how many to order. There were a lot of wicker decorative items. Some of them were basket like in nature and I would put things from the walls in them. Some of the huge wood wall units still had many items sitting on the shelves. We were moving them with the things still in place. I have no idea how those things did not fall off. I was always glad when I could push a piece onto an area rug and move it along with no problem. Some of the things were oddly shaped and we had to figure out how to get them down the L-shaped stairwell. Some were extremely heavy. Some that I thought would be really heavy I would see one or two men hoist above their heads and carry them out. Some large items were so light I could lift them with one hand and push them down the stairs myself, even some of the large, stuffed chairs.",

The people there talked candidly. One was trying to get his two dogs, breeder dogs, into a pen in the back of his truck. He wore heavy sunglasses -- his vision was failing. But he was chipper. Many of the parents were somber, and one even said, \"there are a lot fewer dead this time\" I said, \"really, is that so?\", so I could get a response to speak to the fact that yeah, this was a good month -- only 5 dead instead of 20.",

    "report":"Last night's dreams are a little fuzzy in my mind. I remember living somewhere seemingly far away from my own home- most likely somewhere in the country, but I don't really remember any buildings. I remember meeting two girls there who I thought I had met once previously (in dreams, I guess, maybe the same night). For some reason I wanted to be really friendly with them, and I felt some kind of personal attachment. I don't remember much about them, except that they lived far away (Although it seemed I was far away from home, I think they were even further), and I wanted to keep contact with them. Then, I was away from them for some reason, and I was thinking of things I wanted to ask them next time I saw them, such as if I could have their address\/email address and if they wanted to stay \"friends forever\". Then, when I went to look for them, they were gone- just left, gone back home. At that time I was in a house that very much resembled my grandfather's house (dreams are weird in that you always know something looks familiar, but can only guess if that wasn't what it was supposed to be, or if you really did make that connection in the dream). There was a small van (it was definitely the same van we went to the college Model UN in), and I saw someone get inside, Mr. Rosetti I think. And as far as I knew, we were going into the city for a school trip. On the van (which seemed more like a really big, fancy bus when I got in there), there was a guy lecturing us about something. I was so tired, half-asleep within my dream; and it was a weird situation. It was kind of like a partial dream within a dream. The lecturer asked a question, and in my \"dream\" I imagined I knew the answer so I raised my hand, and when he finally called on me, I said I didn't know the answer, and I only raised my hand because I was half asleep and I imagined either I knew the answer or that he was asking a different question. I don't remember anything after this.",

Very pregnant. She was helping the sister sand the floors in one bedroom. A lot of remodeling needed to be done. They were talking about how the place was had at a good price partially because someone died on the stairs years before. A roll of tape or something dropped and rolled out the door and went down the stairs and stopped halfway down. The pregnant sister went after it. For some reason, nails covered the stairs. Some were sticking up without explanation. The sister got a foreboding feeling and told her pregnant sister to hold onto the rail. The wood on the steps was scratched and had chunks missing from it. She reached for the door, but the seam was gone. It wouldn't open. But then she double took. The seam was back. She opened the door and let the light and outside air come in. She led her sister by the hand to the bottom and outside. She insisted the stay there for a while. The pregnant sister thought she was being silly. Then very sinister sounding rock music with a steady, deep drum and base picked up just inside normal hearing range. There were noises of sex and violence intertwined. She looked inside and felt death. The older sister ran with her younger sister to her old car parked out front, got in, and started driving. The younger sister was starting to get afraid after her initial reaction of skepticism. As they drove away and looked back, the house looked like it was burning, like a gothic building burning in a dim, ashy haze of fire and smoke.",

It slowed me down and ??? trouble ??? play ??? of the locker room ??? I immediately went to the bear section at the zoo and picked up a black bear cub.

    "report":"The dream was very strange and it was partly like a movie and partly like something that was really happening. There was this man and who he was, I'm not sure. But this other man, and he was a dean from a nearby university who was coming to attend this meeting, was going to kill him in this terrible way. He must be on his guard and not take anything from anybody to eat. He wouldn't know who this person was. So when the meeting was to be held, this very strange-looking person came up to the man and offered him something in this bottle. This was a little, fairly big yellow pill. The man was about to take it and eat it. I shoved the bottle from this bad man's hand and it fell onto these marble steps. This broke into several pieces and the pill started foaming on the marble as if it had been acid. The vile man was put out and told what it did. It was something horrible. It just dissolved away our whole digestive system in a few seconds. Then you die, of course. He went into this in some detail. Though he was frustrated in this attempt to kill this man, he was going to try again. So I, having seen him, knew if I could get away that maybe I could bring help somehow. So I pretended to be going along with the two people, but I broke away and ran down these stairs. I came to the chief of police's office. I knocked and then I didn't even wait. He was sitting here with this girlfriend of mine from my hometown. I told him that somebody had tried to murder somebody and he didn't. He admitted that he had murdered several other people. He just had to do something to stop him. And he didn't seem too concerned, the police chief didn't. The girl didn't seem very interested and I told her it was her own father that man had tried to kill, but that didn't seem to upset her very much either. Just about then the bad man came down there with the other man. The police chief took a gun and pointed it at him and said he was under arrest. He did come in and sit down, but he acted rather smug as if we weren't going to be able to keep him or hold him. You know, we didn't have any evidence or anything. The man he was going to kill seemed rather reluctant to say anything. I told him that I had been a witness too. Then it seems that this had been real and yet it hadn't been real and the man who had, the other man who had tried to murder was making a movie and was really terrified because when he smoked a few cigarettes, he got very cross-eyed. It reminded me about a Japanese warrior or something, but he said it wasn't. Then we were going over the story and we were talking about if you had seen enough stories like this, ordinary life would seem so very dull and everything. Then it seemed as if I was walking away from the movie set after the movie over these great number of stairs. I was walking away from this big house over these stairs that were rather hard to get up and I was somewhat worried because I thought somebody in the house was going to follow me. But I went on up finally and got away and was starting to get thru these woods which were very dense and very thick and sort of, the ground was wet and squishy and I didn't want anybody to see me. But these two sort of simple ladies who were in the movie were out walking in the woods and I knew that they were going to see me. There were, it was a strange woods because every once in a while there were electrical connections and cords around, and the ground was so wet and these wires were just lying there. And I wondered if anybody turned them on or anything, if somebody might not get shocked. I was trying to hide from these ladies behind these curtains in these woods, but they saw me and it didn't seem to make too much impression on them. Where I had hidden was at this door which led into this farmer's house. Apparently, although there was a room there, the other door was locked. I thought perhaps it had been cut off by snow because there was snow around, and I went back a little bit the way I had come and I came to another door which I could get into and this was a storeroom in this farmer's house. There was furniture and stuff piled around, and a window in front which had been covered up with some cardboard, but I uncovered it and looked out. It was very wide, flat land and it was evening, and the farmer and his family were coming home. Their front door was right next to the storeroom, and I was certain they would see me because in the first place with all the cardboard off the window, light would show thru it. They didn't seem to notice me, but anyhow I left and went back home. Home here was apparently my hometown, although the house wasn't the same as my parents' house. I went in and just talked to everybody for a while and that was it.",

    "report":"I went to a SXDS meeting at a huge hotel. Ona S, Wes S, Jo U. The purpose of the meeting was to introduce a new product. The producers of the new item were in attendance. It was being held in a very, very large room - almost like a ballroom. It was rather dark and there were a lot of curtains along the back wall. The rectangular tables were set up classroom style. There was significantly more room between each table than you would normally expect. The producers were in the back of the room. They were there primarily to see how well we would do introducing the product. I wanted to give each manager an order form and have them fill it out and leave it as they left the meeting to assure that we would get lots of orders. I didn't think they would have a problem with this as they were accustomed to doing this when ordering other things for the store. We had some kind of video presentation of the product. It was very theatrical. The projector was behind the curtains at the back of the room. I kept going back and forth between where the managers were and where the projector and operator were. It seems that there was a glitch that I was trying to work out. I needed to get it taken care of quickly so the producers wouldn't even realize that there was a glitch. When we got ready to leave, for some reason Jo V thought I shouldn't be walking out alone so she was going to walk out with me. She suggested that I use the restroom before we leave. I told her no but she insisted. I decided it was just as well as it had been awhile since I had been able to and I knew it was about time for my period to begin so it would better to go now than to try to wait until I got home. There was some deal about the restrooms, what was inside them or finding them. When we were finally ready to leave, the hotel was so expansive that we kept getting lost and couldn't find the way out. We would enter a hallway and Jo V thought we should be going one way and I thought we should be going another. Then we saw some celebrity sitting alone in a chair in the middle of a hallway so we stopped and asked him how to get out. He told us but I don't think we believed him. One turn we took just led us back into the meeting room where we were initially. ",

It is full of artefacts - dusty objects and decorations of south American origin. There are ceiling mounted fans with old-fashioned decorated detailing. The bathroom is equally old-fashioned - Victorian perhaps with fittings from the 1950s. High ceiling, decorated cracked tiles and large sinks. High up on the ceiling are dozens of enormous insects - stick insects, moths, Beetles, Cockroaches. They are disgusting yet structurally beautiful - architectural. It looks like they are attached by their jaws, hanging off the ceiling like ticks sucking blood. I'm shocked and disgusted, yet fascinated. I look down and realize a couple of them are attached to my bag. It's quite dark in here, and I can't tell in the half-light whether they are alive or dead or in fact fake, so I take my bag carefully from the bathroom to my room to attempt to photograph them. I'm too squeamish to get too close, and there isn't enough light in any of the rooms, so I try to use the camera flash to take some close-up pictures.

[Something is happening that involves mention of a hospital.] I'm going to walk up to the street [and do something, maybe I'm going for a car or a cab or an airplane]. As I walk over a slight rise, I can see more of downtown and the power lines that crisscross the air. On one of them are two figures, much larger than life but somewhat smaller than parade balloons - one's Batman (black suit and cape, like the movie), and the other one's female, and they're lying on the wire, embracing as if they're making love, but with all their clothes on. She's got long dark hair and dark clothing. I don't know precisely who she is, but I accept this as quite normal. It's apparently some sort of promotional stunt for the next Batman movie. What it appears to be is two real people inside some sort of giant costumes, and they operate inside them as if it was themselves. As I walk, watching from time to time, they get more vigorous. Out of the corner of my eye it looks quite real. Finally their humping gets real exaggerated, and they raise up in the air high enough to turn over backwards and fall off. As you might expect, Batman \"flies\" down, doesn't drop like a stone, and goes out of sight behind something. I'm still walking on, and now I see the two of them standing on a rise, their arms out, facing more or less my direction, their mouths open. They're singing, but I'm too far away to hear. More of the promotion. Up in the sky, there are little private planes from time to time - actually quite a lot of traffic - and now some of them are towing banners that say, \"Batman\". I pass by them and come to Lloyd's house. Lloyd lives right on a main street in a sort of industrial district; next to maybe an auto salvage yard, across from an empty lot, like that. It's part of a group of houses, though, an interconnected project a bit like condos, maybe, and the road by them goes from the street back, past his house, into the complex. I go through his house and speak briefly to him and a woman friend who's with him. [Whatever was going on where I started out, they are part of, or at least they know all about it.] They ask if there's anything for them to do, and I say no, I'm just going on out to get [the car?]. About now, I notice what I'm wearing. It's a sort of baby-doll top and underpants, seems to be blue or black, something dark, but quite short, nearly doesn't reach my thighs, and suddenly I'm very self-conscious. I could do something about it, I guess, ask Lloyd or the other woman if I could change, or something, but I don't want to appear unsure of myself, or scared. So I go on out, wondering if they're thinking I shouldn't be going outside dressed like this. I step onto the sidewalk, take a few steps, stop and think about it some more, get concerned whether Lloyd and the woman can see me dithering through the window, take a few more steps past the window, stop again. Agonize a bit more, then give up and decide to go back. I walk down the drive next to the house, not looking at it so as they won't see me retreating, and pass the house till I come to the end of the building, where there's a carport and then another bit of matching building. At the back of this I turn in between the houses and meet a boy, maybe 10 or 11. He's new here, just hanging out, and I talk to him for a minute. [I find myself explaining to him how these houses are arranged, that this back part is a laundry (very nice, too, completely carpeted and even lounge furniture this end) that's shared by Lloyd and the guy behind him.]",

    "report":"My husband was going to visit this friend of ours, this Mexican-American in his earlier 30's up towards the library, and I got special permission to go with him on the grounds that he was my friend too and I knew him. I had to get permission from the dean or something like this. It seemed a little strange that we should be taking him on a tour of the library because he lives here and he perfectly knows well the library. But at any rate, we were going to and I was waiting in the library for my husband and this man to come, and I was standing by the room with big double doors with little oval windows in them that the freshman library lectures were being given in about a week ago, and now it was the freshman reading room and the doors were open. It was so strange because everything in it -- the people, the walls, everything, the tables -- were various shades of gray or white, just like a black and white movie. And I would look into this room and it would look so strange that I just couldn't believe it, and I would look back out and everything else would look normal. It was just so peculiar. I've never seen anything like it and I couldn't understand why everything in there would be gray. I figured that it was some trick of the light, that the people couldn't really be that way. No, not even their faces, their whole appearance was gray. When my husband his friend came up, I told them about  it. We looked in, but now when we looked in, although everything wasn't in perfect color, it was sort of a pale sort of wash of color over the scene and it had changed. We started off walking thru the library. Then the whole dream changed. It was sort of this melodrama going on. Sometimes I was watching and sometimes I might have been either of the 3 characters that were in it. The 3 characters were this man and these 2 women who looked -- no, they didn't look exactly alike; they did except for the color of their hair, I think -- who both loved this man and the blonde-haired woman was some sort of princess or some high-born lady, and the other girl who was dark-haired was from the lower classes or something. And this noble woman was very jealous; even if she thought this man would love this other girl rather than her, she would rather have him dead than be with her. So there was this big scene. Somehow the noble woman had gotten the man arrested on some sort of charges. It must have taken place at least a couple of hundred years ago, if not in the Middle Ages, because it seems the king's men had come out to arrest him and were going to put him in this big dungeon or something, and everybody was carrying swords around. It was really a strange thing and sometimes I would be a man and sometimes I would be a woman. If I were the man, sometimes I would love one of the girls and sometimes the other. Finally, I believe, the man and the dark-haired lower class girl had gotten away somehow and were running off together. So the blonde-haired girl, the noble girl, couldn't stand this chunk of ice with some sort of magical properties it was supposed to have, and she threw it at the couple as they were embracing, whereupon the couple were both near, and near one of them was a man that she had loved and the one who had been changed from a girl was now a troll, so the dream said. This wasn't the effect this ice was supposed to have. It was supposed to just kill them, I think. The last scenes of this were exactly as if I read a comic book about it because the scenes were in these little boxes and what was going on was written down at the bottom. I would see one of these scenes sort of frozen, and then maybe it would be animated for a while. It was sort of unusual.",

    "report":"I was running a cafe along with a group of peer students. I knew all of them, though the only two I can identify right now is Karyn L and Mary Kay C. All of us rotated in covering the various responsibilities rather than each person having one assigned job. The cafe had three individual glass doors at the front. Each one locked separately. We had decided as a group that whoever was closing at night, usually a single person, would lock all three doors, after the last patron had left, while they completed the closing tasks. One person would come back late to leave with whoever was closing. That person would use their key to enter the cafe through one of the glass doors. One night I was going to be closing. When the person who was coming back left for the night she left all three doors unlocked, even though all the patrons were gone. I was in the back so I didn't realize this until later when she came back. I was very upset to know that I had been in their that late at night, alone, with the doors unlocked. She said she didn't lock them because she didn't think it was necessary and she didn't want to bother with her key when she came back. A group of us had a somewhat heat discussion about this. Everyone but this one person agreed that we should stick to our original agreement to lock all three doors and use our keys when we come back. We felt it was in the best interest of whoever was closing each night. When some people had certain jobs they seemed to be much less productive. This was either because they were uncomfortable with the job because they didn't feel they knew enough to do it well or simply because they felt they weren't good at it. Sometimes it was that they simply didn't like that job and didn't want to do it. On one wall of the cafe there was a very large wooden box on the wall. It was square, dark wood, and about six or more inches deep. It had wood slats that divided the whole box into equally sized small square storage spaces. Each of those squares was about three by three inches. We used this to store things that we wanted readily accessible for our patrons. that we could either grab things quickly or they could grab them. Each space had an assigned purpose. Some of the student staff had not been doing a good job of putting things back where they belong. I found this very irritating. A group of us were discussing this, though I was likely the one most irritated with it. Some of the spaces had what I can best describe as piles of dirt or sand in them. something with a similar make-up and look. Some people had been taking the items and just laying them in the appropriate space but in this dirt or whatever inappropriate substance it was in those spaces. Where items had been placed in an inappropriate space I was removing them and putting them in the space they belonged in. I was doing this while talking with the others about use of this box. I was having an individual discussion with Karyn L, though I think Mary Kay C was within hearing distance. It didn't really get heated but we both had strong convictions about our point of view. I finally decided not to continue because Karyn L is much more strong-willed than I am and I just didn't feel like continuing the debate. I especially didn't feel that I had the energy to win. ",

    "report":"I was waitressing at a nice restaurant.  A group came in and sat at my table.  Everything was going wrong, I could not get anything out fast enough, it was taking forever to do anything.  The party asked for things, appetizers, soup, etc., and it seemed nothing they wanted was in the kitchen, and I spent all this time hunting for things, dishes, spoons, saucers.  By the time I brought them anything, the evening had pretty much passed.  Anthony was there as restaurant manager.  I asked him where things were, and he'd tell me.  It seemed I did not know my way around, like it was my first day on the job.  I couldn't find anything, and when the party asked questions about the menu, I didn't know the answers.  The soup was memorable.  The party asked what soups were being served.  I told them we had two, one was onion, and one was an unusual creation by the chef.  The main woman at my table was very outspoken.  She said, I thought it was a carrot soup, and I came here just for that carrot soup.  I said, well the two soups right now are the onion and this creation one, but he's still supposed to make the carrot soup at 8:00 tonight.  It was not yet 8:00.  Then I told her kind of snotty:  What does it matter, if the carrot soup is not ready.  We have these other two soups.  It's not like you knew beforehand that it would be carrot, you came here wanting soup, and we have soup.  Who cares if it is not carrot.  Then I realized maybe she had called beforehand, and found out about the carrot soup.  I was embarrassed.  I asked if they'd like to sample a bit of the unusual soup.  I told them the soup had mushrooms, some other unusual vegetables, fresh thyme and herbs, and a layer of toasted bread in it.  They said yes.  I went to the kitchen.  This was when I couldn't find, cups, saucers, spoons.  None of the dishes matched each other, although they were nice dishes.  It was taking forever just to get three samples of soup out.    I finally got three small beautiful cups, like teacups, and went to fill them.  The soup was truly weird.  One cup I filled actually had a whole blackberry in it.  I made sure that blackberry was laying on top of the soup, in view.  The others I filled had big clumps of herbs in them.  They looked really wild, with nature things throughout them, almost like sticks and leaves, dark fruits, and vegetables.  The bread in the soup I had to cut up and put into the cups.  When I finished, I realized I had used up all the soup just with these samples, so they couldn't order full cups anyway.  When I brought it to the table, I realized it was now past 8:00 by this time.  I realized they could have had the carrot soup after all, it had taken me so long just to get organized, oriented, even though I seemed to have no other tables.   After they had the soup, I asked if they'd like to order anything else, expecting them to be totally pissed off about how long it took.  They decided not to order entrees, but two wanted dessert:  a chocolate cheesecake, and the main woman wanted a plum cake.  I was amazed.  I thought they were going to leave.  I commented to Anthony in back about them ordering dessert straight after soup with no dinner.  It was pretty late by now, however.  I also dreamed that I called the movie theater and asked what was playing.  There were three movies on, but they were all kids movies, like disney.  I told the theater, how can all of your movies be kids movies, don't you show anything for adults?",

    "report":"I have to write a paper for English on \"Catalogue of the Exhibition\". I had created a piece of art, we all had. We were at this sort of camp out in the middle of the forest. The entrance was a dirt road where a restaurant was. It was built into a cliff so that it was hanging over. The A-frame roof was rock with little caves containing houses (birdhouses?) in them. Anyway, at this camp, it seemed like a school trip, lots of young people. A famous artist came. She look like Mrs. S. with grey hair. She had an art exhibit. All the pieces of art were copies of ours (mine, Edies, others). She had tried to re-create our art by doing a frame by frame thing of how we made our paintings. Her work that was copying my work was in 4 pieces. One was an orangy peach shawl with long strings; one was on the wall, it was pure white with sort of indentations of flowers; another was a pair of cowboy boots; and the other was something practical(??) When I saw the show, I was pissed. She was getting tons of praise for our artwork. I rallied with some others to steal her work since it was really ours. Some liked the idea, some didn't. Me and Kathy took the shawl and the painting. But then I began to feel guilty. I went to the artists room to ask if I could have the pieces. I forget what she said but I think it was yes? for money? I'm back at home now and I have to write my paper. I decide that I will go back to the place in the forest and write about my art and Moorash's. Before I go, Sharon receives a telex from Jahn for me. She gives it to me and automatically Sharon and Diana look over my shoulder. I say, \"Stop it!\" but they think I'm joking. Then I yell, \"Is everything public property?!\" and storm out and into Jake's room, slamming the door. The telex is long. It's about getting a group of people together to go to the woods to do our papers. The way he wrote the letter was cool. He put it inside the binding of a book and left some of the book pages in it. It was very sexual with a lot of drawings. I wanted him all by myself so I didn't want Diana and Sharon to know. [Mrs. S. = sister's mother in law; Edie = friend; Sharon = friend and roomate; Diana = good friend and roomate; Jake = roomate; Jahn = friend; Kathy = childhood friend]",

    "report":"I've just come through a house [I've forgotten whose - a man, someone we know well and work closely with, we're close to him, a relative?] and come to the bathroom, a tiny one with a shower stall. In it is a friend of mine, who I call by name [Greyraven? Bill W? Somebody on the slender, and I think shortish, side - I'd previously been dreaming of Harry Anderson, may be a variation on him, but he's taller] and I announce with glee, \"Guess what? I've finally used up all the water in the shower - that is, I've run all the water through that shower head, and now we can get a new one!\" Hooray. This is neat, you know? You see, the old shower head is somehow unsatisfactory, it's old and worn, won't put out a steady stream of water or something, and we've been wanting to improve on it. So now we can get a nicer one, brand new, that'll work better. And (the guy I'm talking to) he says, you know what else? We could actually extend this bathroom, just by moving the wall out - we could double its size. So we go look out the window in the shower stall [by the way, he was just in there shaving at the sink or something] - outside there's a pretty big parking lot, with the sort of carports you see at old restaurants and other places, corrugated roofs held up by steel posts, for 2 cars to park nose-to-nose. It extends from this 1st row just across from the window to the front of the building, with lots of space between. This is a part of town where you might find such things, reminds me of down Lamar where Automotive used to be. The house is old, and while it's not ramshackle, is no showpiece either. Comfortable, though, and a lot of people come here. Actually I think a goodly number live here. I'm concerned for a minute about this extending the bathroom out into the parking lot, it would come almost if not all the way to the 1st parking slot there, then how would people walk by to the front? [The building makes a bit of an \"L\" beyond us to the left, the back of the building, and the back door's used all the time. By the way, beyond the carport - it's maybe eight cars deep - there are trees, maybe there's a creek down there. Forward, to our right, you see the other couple carports, then a bit of sidewalk and street - probably dead-ends; there's a car-parts-looking place across the street.] But then I think, no, really, it wouldn't be any big deal to give up one parking space on the end [2, actually], since the whole lot is seldom filled up anyway. This 1st strip usually is, though. Like I said, there are always a lot of people in and out of here. Anyhow, we see how it would be a very workable thing to extend the bathroom, very nice, we'd like it a lot.",

    "report":"I was in Russia on some sort of government mission along with a number of other people. I don't recall how many. We were talking to Khrushchev and other Russian officials about world peace. Khrushchev spoke excellent English. We went back to the United States and made some reports and Khrushchev was due to come over for a conference with President Kennedy. I was telling Kennedy how Khrushchev spoke excellent English, and he was sort of disappointed because he spoke excellent Russian and he wanted a chance to speak it at the conference. I also told him that Khrushchev seemed to want peace, and yet he really wasn't doing anything to get peace, but rather engaging in military buildups and the like. Khrushchev and his party arrived and the meeting seemed to be held in a tavern or something like that. There were booths along the wall and tables and Khrushchev was sitting up at one end of the room and I was sitting down at the far end talking with Kennedy. Kennedy asked Khrushchev something about why he had pounded his shoe at the U.N. and Khrushchev obligingly took off his shoe and pounded it on the table and made some sort of reply which I don't recall. Kennedy then put on some sort of a robe. I guess that's the best description of it. It looked like it was made out of a thousand mops. It included some kind of headdress. It looked like some wild sort of Russian dressed in fur, but the fur looked more like mops and he went over to Khrushchev and put down five glasses on the floor, arranged in a square with one in the center. He had Khrushchev stand up on the last two glasses and told him to step over onto the other two, and Khrushchev stepped on the center glass, then on the other two. Then Kennedy stepped on two of the glasses, then right onto the other two without using the center one. He told Khrushchev that was the trouble with him; he wasn't very brave or something because he stepped on the center glass. By this time Khrushchev also seemed to have one of those mop-like robes on, in numerous colors incidentally, and then they started dancing around each other, then they grabbed each other and started wrestling. Finally I believe Kennedy got Khrushchev down and I and some of the other unknown people were thinking that this might be a good way to settle world peace. Let the two most important people fight it out here and now. Then Khrushchev was hurt and he was going to be flown back to Russia to get some medical attention. At this point in the dream there were some sudden shifts. It seems that now some sort of Russian pilot was hurt and had to be taken back to Russia, and I and some other people were driving him back in a car. Other people have already been driven back to Russia in other cars and I was sitting in the back while we were driving back to Russia, except now the setting was in my hometown and we were driving toward the countryside. Once again the dream suddenly changed so that now I was riding a bicycle along some back country roads. I'm not sure now, but I seem to be 14 or 15, something like that, and the place I was going to was a Boy Scout camp I went to as a youngster, and I was riding along on my bicycle and also trying to hitchhike cause I was holding out my thumb to cars passing by cause I knew that I had about 75 miles to go and it would take me a long time to ride there on my bicycle. I went thru some crossroads in a small town and the road seemed quite familiar here. As I went on beyond this, the road I was on turned into a dirt track. I knew I was lost because I had gotten off the road, so I turned back around and came on to some people on the road and asked them, I believe, where Route 54 went, and the people told me to just pedal along and I would see it on my right. So I got on it and kept going along it and I came to a place where the road split into the regular route and the scenic route and I took the scenic route. This was all very similar to places I have been to before actually. Now I came to a spot where a ferry went across the river and somehow I had driven my bicycle right up onto the ferry, and I have been on this ferry in a dream before, but I am certain there is nothing correspondent in reality anywhere. First I wanted to get off the ferry because I didn't have any fare, but it was too late as it was already starting out. The ferry got halfway across and stopped in midstream while the stewardess, a woman just like the airline stewardess, collected the fare from the passengers. When she came to me, I had taken my wallet out and I told her I didn't have a car and she said there wouldn't be any fare for me. I put my wallet back and I didn't seem to have much money anyway, except maybe for a couple of dollars. The ferry went on across the river and docked on the other side. I rode my bicycle down the ramp and started riding up out of the place and found I really wasn't on the road, but I was on a dirt track. Right directly to my left there was a woman pushing a baby stroller up another dirt road and that was really the right road out of the place as it turned out, but it was a very steep road and I wondered how many cars could get up it. It was extremely steep. I went on up and was pulling on my bicycle to bring it on up with me. There was a little boy ahead of me who started slipping some and fell back into me and I caught him and then he climbed on up. Then the last stretch of the road I was climbing up there was a mattress that was placed at a very high angle and I reached up and grabbed the top of it and pulled myself over. The bicycle seemed to have disappeared by now and as I pulled the mattress back, there was a machete in a sheath underneath the mattress, and I remember that I had hid that machete there the last time I had been there, a year or two ago. And it had my name on it, except my name was Leonard something or other. So I picked up my machete and I also had a sheath knife with me now, and climbed over a sill which was right in front of me now and into the office of this place and went over to the drinking fountain to get a drink of water. Somebody spread the rumor that the machete I was carrying belonged to somebody whose name started with an R and had been stolen. So somebody saw me with the machete and thought I had stolen it, but I told them that was ridiculous because my name was obviously on here. It wasn't the name of the person from whom the machete had been stolen. This is about all I recall. Quite a number of elements in this dream are related to things we did and talked about last night, including the route number 54. We were on a Route 55 last night. The costume of Khrushchev and Kennedy, the mop-like thing, we talked about someone who was dressed in a robe and turban-like affair and several other minor things like this.",

There were too many people in the grocery store so we went to the clothes store. She was picking out cat food for kitty, but I told her kitty wouldn't eat Friskies. She liked grape jelly better. But the grape jelly (1 quart) was runny and almost empty so we didn't get anything. Valerie's mother was getting nervous, and taking out art books. Learn how to draw books.

In the back of the balcony were portable toilets, but the door was fake wood to look like the church. Ladies in the choir were singing awful and I decided to go the bathroom to not listen.

As I walked in the door I couldn't believe how packed the store was for that early on a Sunday morning. I couldn't figure out why. You could barely get in the door for all of the shopping carts sitting ready for use. Beyond that the store was as crowded as you would see on Christmas Eve. I took a cart and proceeded. As I got inside the door I debated what my quickest strategy would be. Should I go for the cards first and then produce or the other way around? I was standing right by the lettuce so I got the head lettuce and then decided to get the thank you cards. It was hard to maneuver because there were so many people, and with shopping carts too it just felt like madness to me. I laid my white handbag in the child seat of the cart. It didn't have shoulder straps on it. I had something brown, like a brown folded bag, lying on top of it, though I don't know why. It was still easy to see the handbag. I walked away from my cart to get the thank you notes. They were on the top shelf. I had to step on something and really reach to get them. There were people everywhere and I was afraid I might bump into someone as I reached or hit someone with my arm or elbow as I came back to the floor. I kept looking both ways as I lowered myself back to the floor. I had the head of lettuce in my hands also. I just wanted to get out of there so I quickly turned and headed back to the produce section to get the tangerines. Just as I got over there I realized I had left my shopping cart sit in the other aisle, and my handbag was still in it. I panicked and practically ran back to that aisle hoping it would still be there. When I first got there I got very upset because I didn't see it. I looked in some other aisles and found it. I was very relieved and realized that I had just looked in the wrong aisle initially. ",

I was sitting in a chair and holding one on each side of me trying to help them warm up and letting them rest and getting their rest back. I don't know what happened from there. I got up to leave and their father, Eddie Arnold, came out of his bedroom. I saw five other men in there with him. A couple of them saw me and kind of made a pass at me. His first wife had died. The younger sister was feeling very lonely and wanted attention. I soon realized that's what both girls wanted. They just wanted all the attention and they didn't give any attention back. The girls had a younger brother and they wanted me to help them keep him out of the room. There were two doors that he could get into and they were side by side. I was trying to hold both doors closed against his efforts. I was trying to find something within my reach that I could block the door with, like a doorstop. I couldn't find anything. The younger sister, I think her name was Sandy [unknown in waking life], kept handing me things. She didn't understand what I was looking for and kept handing me things that weren't going to work. Then I saw that the older sister had a collection of things on the wall and a couple of them were doorstops. One of them had a teddy bear face with little foam pieces that were the facial features. They were on the part that you would stick under the door. So I took the ears and stuff off so I could put it under the door. I knew I could glue them back on when I was done with it. I put it under the door but then it morphed and was no longer a doorstop so it didn't work. I had torn it apart for nothing. I suggested newspaper but that didn't work because he just pulled it right through the door. I tried various things and I ended up having to just sit there and hold the door closed as the girls had wished. I'm thinking the older girl's name was Sharon. Sharon had morphed and was now very small. Her legs had become the size of a Barbie doll. I treated Sandy like a little sister. She had these things out in the hall that were making a lot of noise. I was concerned about bothering the neighbors and convinced her to bring them in. Actually at this point she morphed into a young child. Then I heard someone else in the hallway that was making just as much if not more noise. I asked her what that was and she told me. I told her that was going to have to come in too. She got very sad so I asked her to explain to me what it was. She had these metal pails with water in them and something attached to them that was making all the noise. She would set the water in the hallway on the heat vents. She said that it helped return more water to the land. I asked her if it would work if we took the noisy part off. I said if we just set the pails on the heat vents the water will still return to the land. So that satisfied her and we did that. I went back out in the hall a couple minutes later and the maintenance man was out there. He was upset because the water was sitting there. I explained to him with her standing there what it was for. He really softened and became kind and said that was fine and we could leave them there. Everyone was happy now and we went back into the apartment. I guess sometime along here I had let the little boy back in and he was in his bedroom. I went in and talked to him a little bit and patched things up and made our relationship okay. I was commenting to Sharon on how nice it was to be sleeping with all these people. She looked at me funny and I laughed and I said I just meant having so many family members and loved ones in the house and around you. I said it's just a really nice feeling. She just smiled at me. Then I heard her dad come in and go in his room. I said that I needed to go talk to him for a couple of minutes. I went into his room and that's when he came on to me. At first I tried to resist and then I gave in a little bit. Then I tried to resist again and back and forth. I could see from the light under the doorway that Sharon was pacing back and forth on the other side of the door. Probably wondering what was going on. He had a tub of water sitting by his bed so I asked him to give me a foot massage and that would be my excuse as to why I was in there so long. He soaked my feet in a tub and rubbed them. He was very attentive. It was very nice. One of the girls opened the door and saw us and got really upset. This is odd as I have it recorded twice. The other part of the recording said I used this excuse with Sharon and she was fine with it. They lived in an apartment building as I did. They lived a couple floors above me I think. I tried to go back to my own apartment but I didn't have my key with me and I couldn't remember my apartment number.",

I talked to Frank about it, and he asked me if I was hearing the \"beating trumpets\". For some reason, the thought of any instrument with that description- very ominous, \"beating trumpets\"- frightened me. I told him yes, because he just brought it up, and he got terribly afraid, curling back in fear. The way in which he did this was actually humorous, when I think about it. He was about to run away, and I was really afraid and needed him with me at that point. I wanted to just relax and watch TV together. I didn't want to be alone so I told him, ok, I'm not hearing the sounds anymore. He came back and I asked, \"Is that music coming from the tv?\" Everyone else thought it was a dumb question. Well, actually everybody laughed, thinking I was joking. I think Warren responded that it was coming from the TV. Then I was in a building that I made out to be the \"QRS Video Store\" and tape rentals were less than $1. I had money to buy one, so I rented a video. I don't remember which one or if I even knew at the time. Next, I'm in a big, old, general or surplus store where most of the place wasn't even being used. There were a couple sections where I could buy CD's, and I'd been wanting to replace my Moxy Fruvous CD that I lost (really) so I thought I'd buy one, but wasn't sure between that and another CD I wanted. Then, on the way back, I'm with my school and we get on this floor space that turns into a whitewater raft. All of a sudden there are like 8 people on the raft, which I made to be way too much. Furthermore, they were mostly people from outside of school. We were diving into the water. They dived over me, and I thought I would drown and not be able to get enough air.",

The band members had mixed emotions about the comeback. Micky Dolenz was the one that wanted it most. Peter Tork and Mike Nesmith were easily able to let it go. I don't remember hearing Davey Jones' feelings about it. Mickey wanted the comeback very badly and was very upset that it wasn't working out. I got a call from an agent or some such person in California. She wanted to come meet with them. Someone had suggested that she meet Mickey in BR near the train station. I called her and asked if she would be staying in town and she said that she would be returning to CA on the same day. I then suggested that they just meet at the airport. It would be easier for everyone and save her time. She said that was a good idea. She gave me her flight information, airline and flight number, and told me to have him meet her at baggage claim. After I finished speaking with her I realized that I did not get her flight number nor did I make arrangements for how they would find each other. Then I realized that she might know what Mickey looks like from past TV programs and albums. I called Mickey and shared the good news. I told him he could get online and look up her flight to see what time it arrives. Since she is leaving the same day I thought it was odd that she would want to meet at baggage claim. I have the sense that she was going to have baggage with her but I don't know why she would. I was at the airport and met her. I was sitting and chatting with her and employees from the airline came up and spoke with her. They obviously knew each other. I summized that she used to work for the airline. We went to sit in a different place in the airport, at a small round table. A gentleman came up to bring us something and he knew this woman also. They were old friends. He was tall, average build, brown hair but balding, and wore glasses. He had on a white shirt. He worked there, maybe at a restaurant at the airport. As we sat there we were watching this large crowd of people, mostly women, yelling and screaming. It turns out they were watching the Monkees perform. I said to this woman, see how much they love them? She nodded her head yes. I don't know if this was happening live or on TV. The woman's male friend came up to the table again and as he began to walk away she said, Oh. I'm sorry. Let me introduce you to my dear friend Mark. [unknown if this is someone I know in waking life.] He turned back around and shook my hand. I noticed he was wearing a wedding ring but had the impression that he was single. I don't know what gave me that impression. I was thinking what a nice man he was. A little later the woman and I were sitting and talking with him. He had something written across his forehead. It was probably five or six lines of text, very clearly readable, and an arrow with a red stem and blue tip. There was also a birthmark that looked a bit like an x. At first I thought the text and arrow were there for medical reasons and I felt sad for him that he had to live with that and how that must get people's attention and cause them to stare and such. It was impossible not to notice if you look at him but I tried not to look at it long enough to read what it said. I finally gave in though and read it. When I read it, it seemed to be there for fun, saying something about beer and I don't know what else. Then I thought it was just odd.",

Her husband comes in unexpectedly - he is a very unpleasant man, and Karen is very uncomfortable - you could say she even looks scared, and it's apparently because I'm there - she's not supposed to have visitors, it seems, and he is very disapproving. I feel intimidated myself, and figure I'd better go. Outside, I see some of Peter's sculpture - he's an artist - at the entrance to the house. One of them, on the left, is a sort of spire, or extremely large spike. It's metal, dark, pointed at the top, wider at the bottom, and there's something at the bottom that looks like a small dog lying on its back with its head away from me and its feet up, almost as if it were impaled on the spike. Another, smaller dog, a puppy, is standing in front of it (and the not dissimilar piece next to it), barking. This whole thing is up on a ledge or platform almost at eye level. As I look at the first piece, I am more and more disconcerted - it really does look real - it couldn't be, could it? I stare at it, fascinated. Then suddenly it moves, kicks its back legs up as if it was trying to pull free, to get up. It is real! Oh hell. Oh, hell. I don't want to believe this. He's actually impaled a dog on this thing, because he thinks it's art. Oh, hell. It goes through my mind to rescue it, but how in the world could I possibly do anything that would help? I know it must be bleeding to death, why in the world is it still alive anyway? I don't want to look around at the other side, on my right, that's been obscured by the puppy - but I do, and sure enough, yes, there's blood gushing out from its side, hell, there's nothing I can do, I've got to get away from here. [Either I go back in and tell Karen about this, Peter being gone again, and she decides to come with me, or on my way to the car she catches up, with her little boy, knowing she has to get away herself, and protect her child from this man, who's been getting increasingly more dangerous.]",

One of them was like a flower arrangement sitting on some goblets and there was water flowing, kind of like a table top water fountain. I finally said, we have got to go. We have got to get out of here. We finally found this one room and there were people that we knew in there and people that knew she had run away and left her fiance at the altar. We were talking about how hungry we were. This one woman came up who had baked the cake. She was so sad and distraught because no one was going to enjoy her cake. She had made some other cakes for dessert as well. For some reason she said we could taste them as long as we didn't cut into them. Like we could taste, we should take some of the decorations off the top to taste. I asked her where the wedding cake was and told her I really wanted to see it. She took us to see it. It was three squares like Mother and Daddy's. She said, but don't touch the wedding cake. So, a couple of us lifted icing decorations off these smaller cakes and were eating those. Someone took them off the wedding cake also and was eating those. Then I realized that someone had actually cut into the cakes. We were picking up pieces of those cakes and eating them. Some of them were ice cream cakes. The fiance didn't seem to be very upset when he saw this. He was crouched down next to another woman at a table and talking to her. I with this friend of mine, who was the bride-to-be, to talk to them a bit. He didn't seem to be upset with her or anything. I told my friend that I thought he was attractive and asked her if she would mind if I went out with him. She said, no, that was fine but that I would have to wait because it would be improper for me to approach him right away. As we were walking away I commented on how nice he was and she agreed. We were both surprised that he was handling this so well.",

    "report":"I'm going to a party at Laura's house. I'm wearing a costume, half penguin (my bottom half) and my top half was probably a wizard costume (which I do have physically) because in the dream I think I referred to myself as \"the penguin wizard\". A lot of people laughed at my costume (not at me!). Then I am at Plainview High, presumably. I see Ms. L. (old Spanish teacher) and realize she isn't dead (like I thought in a previous dream). Joey and Herman are there and I start speaking Spanish to them. I was asking them things like \"Que' es un parajo? Pues, un parajo es un animal.\" Then I said something like, \"Tiene pies muy grandes.\" Ok, not all \"parajos\" (birds) have big feet, but maybe I was just talking about penguins. Then I said in English that I don't know how to say \"penguin\" in Spanish and consulted my dream Spanish dictionary. I thought it was very interesting that the Spanish word for penguin, according to my dream, was \"la manera\" which in English translates to \"the way.\" This part gets a little weird. I'm in the living room, sitting on the couch and Grandpa is there. I realize it's September, and can't believe the school year has hardly started. Grandpa asks Paul what his name is, and he gives a false name (I don't remember what he said). He spells it out for him with a straight face although he's joking. Then, I remember Eva said she had a crush on Paul (under his other name) and asks me what she should tell him. I said, \"First you can tell him he's a liar because his name's not [insert false name here].\" The next thing I know, I have received a gift. At first I think it's from my aunt and then I see it's from this family that I haven't seen in years and with whom I don't have a great relationship. The title of the \"poster\" was \"Grown-up Cliches\". Then, I see another regular poster, \"Video Games Through the 20th Century,\" where there was a picture of a video game for each year between 1900 and 2000. I knew there were no video games in 1911, but there was still a game shown. In the picture was snow, and a building that looked like it could have been an igloo. I thought maybe the poster was about games about events occurring during those years (WWII in 1940, et cetera).",

    "report":"In my dream I was with my husband and this friend of his from his hometown, and we neither were in that town or anyplace around here that I know of. The friend's house was this big house on a big sloping lot with a ditch that ran all the way around the edge of it. His friend was lying in this ditch. He had just taken some psilocybin and he was lying there and waiting for some sort of fix to take place. It seemed sort of strange to us and we were talking to him for a while. Then I noticed this beautiful green car in the driveway. It was some sort of a foreign car, some sort of a sports car, and I'm not usually attracted by cars and this is sort of strange, but in this dream I thought this was the most lovely car. I walked around it and as I was walking back around it looked like a gib, colonial wing style chair, very padded and everything, and a slightly different shade of green. Then as I walked down around, it was the car again, and it didn't seem strange to me at all that this should have happened. Then we were talking to this friend some more. Then it seems we all went in the house and we went up to about the third story and there were quite a group of people there. We were preparing things for this sort of mescaline orgy we were going to have. We were going to take mescaline and we had all these little things set up that would be especially nice to see or do while you had mescaline. We had them set up in several different rooms. We were getting everything ready and suddenly it was real late at night. It was 2:45 a.m. and the house was no longer here in this residential area but in this big -- it was like a big office building -- and we were much higher than that from the ground now, about 10 stories, I'd suggest. It was very cold outside. I went to the window and looked out and could see these different people down below, mostly the teenagers and these policemen. These teenagers seemed just to be standing around jeering at the policemen, and the policemen were, all of them were just sort of livid with rage and hitting at these people standing around. So I was calling to the people to come look at this. Oh yes, I was wandering around in a pair of red lace panties and this lacy white half slip and nothing else. But anyway, maybe that's why it was so cold. I got these other people over to look and we raised the window to hear what the policeman was yelling at the crowd. He saw us watching. He was hitting one of these teenagers over the head with his night stick, and then he took another one and threw it at us. It came right into the window and hit one of the boys in the eye. Then he threw another one, but that was too low, and missed. So we all sort of got back from the window because we figured if we stayed around and watched him much longer, it would provoke him and he would come up and get us. So I was watching these people from another window. Then I sort of got involved in the scene down there with some of these people. Some of them were whole families. It wasn't New Year's Eve or anything, and I don't know why they were all standing down there. These families were all, the parents were trying to persuade this mother to go back to their children. Then these particular set of people were talking about their daughter or all of their daughters. They had about five or six who were unmarried, all of them were unmarried, and they were worrying about her. Finally they decided that if they could get just one of the daughters married, it didn't matter to whom, that all of them would settle down and they couldn't want to come roaming around the streets at night like this. So they were going to marry off one of the younger daughters to some lawyer and she didn't much like the idea, and he didn't much either. But they were going to do it since they didn't have much choice. This was a Jewish family and they were going thru all sorts of strange rituals with the bride-to-be and the husband-to-be with these little rites and ceremonies that had some special significance. Apparently, although I don't know if there are actually such ceremonies, I was watching these ceremonies when I woke up.",

It was quite a bit like reading a book, a description, or like seeing one of these travelogues. And I found the main road right away that led to the capital and stated driving along it, and it was very attractive scenery, I guess. It was very green and there were these high grasses on each side of the road. And there was hardly any traffic. Every once in a while you would go thru a very small village which would enact as sort of a toll as you went thru it. And also at these small villages you could buy gasoline very infrequently, so every time you found anybody with a gasoline station, you stopped at once to get some. I came to a crossroads with a stoplight and it wasn't far from the capital. There was a man selling gasoline, and he was selling it from this big tank. He was a farmer or something, and he just had this large tank full and he was going to sell me 21 gallons. And he brought his hose over, and I had some strange contraption that led to the gas tank. I can't remember exactly what it looked like now. It was sort of a hollow tube and there was sand and stuff in it because there was sand on the ground here. And so I had to get this sand out of it before we put the hose in it and filled the tank up. Then I started driving on towards the city, and as I was going there was this woman at this gas tank as well as this man, and she had sort of fallen in love with me -- the man that I was. Meanwhile, I had gotten to the capital city. The whole trip was very short and the time that it seemed to take was not more than an hour. I got to the city, which looked just about like any city, and I drove into it. And I just turned around and drove back out of it, seeing that whatever my mission was, it was accomplished. As I drove back, it seemed that when I got to this particular gas tank again, I stopped where this girl was.",

I can attend one class at school. I can't participate, but I can attend. I go there. No one speaks to me. I feel shame because I used to be quite popular and influential. I feel pride also in not backing down. I sit up in the highest row. The seats are like wooden, old theatre seats. The class is beginning.

Now a woman, like Mirabelle, reminds the group they haven't done the Bible thing and people pull out their Bibles. They begin to recite the Lord's Prayer. I start to do it from memory to be a part of the group, even though I think this is silly. A tiny disabled woman in a wheelchair behind me (maybe has osteoporosis) sarcastically uses silly words to the Lord's Prayer to show her defiance to this issue. I want to join her and would like for her to approve of me, and I want to join the group and have them approve of me. It's a dilemma. Now a young man walks up to a young woman next to me and wants to sit with her. He likes her. Then they change their seats and go down to a front row. I watch them as he tries to shyly move closer to her and she realizes he wants to hug and she moves closer to him and so on. Now one of the center group people calls on a woman on my right.

In one corner was a well, with rope and bucket above, but with no wall or curbing around it. My first wife, Betsy, was yelling at me, mixed with silence and surly anger and great hostility. While her back was turned to me, I gave her a great shove and sent her 15 yards head first down into the well. I was quiet, pleased, and surrounded by a crystal silence for a few minutes with her absent from sight. Then I thought she may be dead and I accused of murder. So I went to the edge and looked over into the darkness. Near the big bucket floating on the surface I saw the outline of her body, clothed, and by looking under the shadow of the bucket, I saw her face, and it had a slight smile and I saw she was alive. I talked to her and said I would lift her up and she looked and said nothing, but looked pleasant. I then tried pulling on the rope, hoping she would catch hold of the bucket. But she did not try. I then told her I would lower a second rope which she could put under her arms, and I and others would pull her out. It was then morning (as if a whole night had gone by) and museum employees were returning. Also, it was like a machine shop and real roundhouse with men nearby with overalls and greasy hands. I was afraid they would look down the well and I would be under suspicion. I looked quietly for more rope and found some. When I went to the edge of the well, Emma was starting up a rope ladder (used on landing craft and helicopters) and she was beautiful, like Botticelli's Birth of Venus, completely naked, with full breasts and ample white-skinned stomach, and smiling, quietly and restrainedly, as in the Botticelli pictures--Venus and Primavera--with wet hair not too shiny and sleek.

I'll go.\" He refused. I said, \"Are you afraid that if something happens to me, others will talk because I'm a girl and you should have gone.\" He muttered, \"Ya.\" I got ready to go. I looked out the window. Water was swirling around. Paul Newman looked to the mountains and said, \"It's not so bad.\" I drew him to the window and showed him. We were looking at the wrong place. He gave me his T-shirt to wear. It was too tight and he had to help me put it on. I was embarrassed. The water was rising and we had to escape out the window. We swam and found a high niche of ground and crawled up there. We kissed. There was a feeling of closeness. We really liked and respected each other. Then, the water receded and we had to go back. He and I were sad because we had to part. He was married and was in love with his wife. I got my horse and sloshed through the lowering water level back to the ranch alone.",

    "report":"I went down to the house of a neighbor of mine. Not too far from here. Some people who recently moved there, Sally and Donald, whom I knew several years ago and lost touch with until they moved out here. I didn't know exactly why I had gone down there because I didn't intent to stay at all. She tells me that they had been selling some of their furniture, and they had one little thing they couldn't sell at all and they were just going to give it away, but they hated to do it, one tiny little chest of drawers. So I said, \"Well, I would like to see it because we could always use extra storage space.\" So she took me back in her room and showed it to me, and it was very small. It was shaped in sort of a triangular-shaped front to it with two doors that opened up, both of these being sort of triangular shaped too, of course. It was a very beautiful little thing. it was just about, oh a foot or a foot and half high and a couple of feet wide. It was carved, this design was carved on the side, it was very beautiful wood, and one the inside it was like one of these roll-top desks. It had all these tiny little drawers and pigeon holes and things in it. I was fascinated by it and I thought, well, I couldn't just take it for nothing, even though she offered it to me and obviously she didn't really want to give it away. She suggested that if I wanted to, that I might pay her $2 and I thought that was remarkably reasonable, so I wanted to my husband to come down and carry it back for me. Just about this time he appeared and so I told him to give Sally $2. He, of course, didn't know why and I was sort of going to surprise him with this beautiful thing. And he did and he was sort of puzzled and I took him back to show him this beautiful cabinet. And she started taking all of her things out of it. My husband took the cabinet home and I was stuck there and I was sort of stranded because I didn't feel it would be polite to go right away and yet I needed to go back. This girl's mother is from some middle Eastern country, and when she was taking, Sally was taking the things out of this cabinet, she took out all of these stamps. They were Israeli stamps, and she apparently carried on quite a lively correspondence with some of her relatives there. And she had made some quite interesting sketches of various things I guess that she intended to send to them. And some of her letters were there too, and she just sort of gone somewhere and left me standing in front of all these things and I thought, well, it wouldn't be too impolite to just sort of glance at them, especially the sketches were so lovely. She had a very strange thing in there. She wrote to one of these relatives not to be too sad that her mother had shot somebody or something which I gathered was one of Sally's parents' favorite horses because, oh, I don't know, her mother had shot the horse and it made her father very unhappy. But Sally was writing her relatives not to be too distressed about this. Finally I did leave, I think, and the scene shifted. At first it seemed to be on a river bank and later it turned out to be the ocean. My husband and I and maybe some friends of ours were going to have a picnic. We were going to cook out there, and I was frying a chicken over this fire, this fire we had built, and there was a group of school children, high school children, who were also having some sort of an outing there. And I for some reason went up to a little store which was high up on the hill. I was going to get some glasses or something. When I got in there everybody was talking about how the ocean was rising, how a storm was coming. And I looked out and all around the store the ocean was. It was possible to walk back down to where I had been, but the ocean apparently came in from this direction of the hill that I had just walked up. It came in on top of that, in that direction. The waves were going down towards the little bank which was almost cut into an island where my husband and our daughter and all these other people were. The waves were going down towards the little bank which was almost cut into an island where my husband and our daughter and all these other people were. The waves were doing something very strange, which waves in actuality never do. The only way I can describe it is to say that the waves had been drawn and animated by this person who does some very wacky cartoons from Mad Magazine. They gave the appearance of sneaking along very quickly toward the shore. Well, I thought I had better go down and warn everybody very quickly cause they were dangerous and I could see the waves breaking right around us, this place where they were fixing food. Nobody seemed to be aware of them. Now let me try to describe something. There was this sort of, there was this long hill down which the waves were coming. Then there was a sort of a little upslope, and a small type of hill and on this the people were. On the other side of this, there was either just a down bank or some grass or there was little river there. And then I was going down a straight line down the hill and up the slope and so forth. There was a small river guarded by a rail and some rock and it was like a little canyon and a very high cliff immediately on the other side of this little river, and down close to the river, to the edge, sort of dark openings like sort of a cave that went back under the cliff a little ways. Well, I was going back as quickly as I could to warn everybody when this huge wave came down and crashed and swept all these people away across and down into this little river, down around these caves. So I ran down as quickly as I could and leaned over the rail that was there and saw my husband and told him to hurry and get out of there. He got out and then we looked and someone had our daughter, and we got her. And there were other waves coming and so we were trying to hurry away from them. And this now becomes a very weird thing because it was a very nightmarish quality and I apparently woke up from it. When I woke up, I was in this very strange state. I had been reading this book about astral projections and different techniques for accomplishing this, and one of them was when you woke up from a dream and were in this trance-like state, you could project your astral body. I thought, well, I'll just try it and so I concentrated on whatever I was trying to concentrate on and sure enough, my astral body or whatever and I started sitting up and this sort of upset me, and I was sort of scared. And just about this time my husband, lying next to me, muttered something and put his arm over me, over the top of me, and this sort of broke the trance and I was awake and I started telling him my horrible dream and how I was projecting. He thought that was very fine. Then I actually woke up, and that's a very strange thing to me because I never had a dream that I thought I woke up from and wasn't actually awake.",

In the dream I was thinking to myself, OK, please God, help me get out of this bed and to the door in time to get to the bedroom door on time so I can lock it. If they could break in through the front door, I don't know why I thought they couldn't break in through my bedroom door. I was in one of those states where I couldn't move, and then I woke up. Then I went back to sleep. This time it was a group of maintenance people from the apartment community. I even had the front door chained. First they came up to the neighbor's front door and mine. They were banging on them with their fists. That alone scared me because it was during the night. I couldn't imagine why anyone would be banging on my door like that in the middle of the night. I was worried that something was very wrong but I still didn't want to go down and answer it because I didn't know who it was or what they wanted. I later found out it was the maintenance guys.

I was lying on my right side so I couldn't see if someone came in my bedroom without moving, but I was sure they had come in. I felt them standing by my bed behind me. I didn't move, hoping they would think I was asleep and leave me alone. I woke up again. When I went back to sleep this time I knew someone was breaking into the apartment, but I didn't know who it was. They didn't make a lot of noise I just knew that someone had gotten in and was on their way upstairs. I was lying on my right side again, so again, I couldn't see if someone entered the room or not.

    "report":"I'm arriving at my grandparents' house on Vanderbilt - they're out, and I want to use their house for something, though I'm terrified they'll come home while I'm still here. (I haven't seen them or most of the rest of my family in years.) It's still just as it was, and frankly I'm surprised. You'd think they'd have remodelled a bit. I look around downstairs, going into the kitchen from the dining room, and on through, suddenly realizing I haven't seen a microwave - I'm looking for one, because I want to use it - surely they've gotten a microwave, wouldn't somebody at least have given them one by now? I go back through, looking carefully, going from the dining room into the room where the sink is - noticing I'd forgotten that the part where the stove, etc., is has no sink - you have to wash dishes in a separate room. Funny. [Note this is inaccurate from the real house; it's as if you'd put a wall in the real kitchen (and moved the refrigerator), but it was never like that.] But no microwave. Oh, well. I go toward the bathroom, and just as I'm crossing the den, the bathroom door opens and a naked girl starts to come out. She has a towel or something and covers herself up somewhat, very startled, and retreats inside the door. I ask who she is and she says she's a reporter or something, works for the newspaper (?), she's sorry, she was just taking a bath, didn't know anybody would be here, etc. - I notice she doesn't tell me exactly what she's supposed to be doing here. I'm a little afraid, because especially I don't know if she's alone. I start thinking about calling the police, and I try to see inside the bathroom beyond her, though she's holding the door as if to prevent it. I explain who I am, but she doesn't know I barely have a right to be here either, and I hope she doesn't ask. I have a bit of an upper hand but I'm worried that there's something potentially dangerous here, and I'm more and more suspicious that there's a man with her - which would make the situation worse. I jostle the door and make more of an effort to look in, and by George there is a man in there! He's naked, and just in the tub - I see him reflected in the bathroom mirror, trying to keep quiet and out of sight. I'll bet she notices me looking and figures I've seen. My apprehension escalates - I'm gonna go call the cops. I go through to the dining room where the phone is, hoping I can make the call before they come after me. I get the number dialled, and I hear sounds while it's ringing, and just as someone picks it up (I think - I'm not positive because I have one ear listening to the sounds at the door) the doorbell rings. I debate whether to answer it or make the call, and in frustration put the phone down. I answer the door, and it's a whole raft of people, some of whom I recognize, all dressed up in their Sunday-go-to-meetin' clothes. Apparently there's been a wedding or some similar celebration, and the reception\/party's being held here. Oh swell. I'm greeted warmly, like I belong here - some of these people are distant relatives, and they're all on a kind of churchy-Sunday high. There are black people here too, and I talk to one woman in a springy flowery dress and hat, with her daughter, similarly dressed - I wonder if I should tell them what's been going on, or are these people somehow dangerous too? Maybe I should just sneak out. I'm feeling confused and frustrated.",

There indoor youth soccer games being held. I was looking through a window that had horizontal slats about every 6 inches. The slats kept me from having a good view. There were other people around. I told someone that I have always enjoyed the small children play soccer, especially the very young ones. By the time I was ready to leave, the group of high school senior girls had just finished their game. Someone said something to them about it being their last high school game. They were walking away from us but turned to their left, looked over their shoulders, nodded their heads yes, and smiled. There were four girls, all very tall, dressed in beige shirts and shorts. They were all wearing their hair in ponytails. Bev, Aunt H, Aunt P, and Mother were all there. I had been selling things online for various people. A man had given me a food processor to sell. It looked very similar to my old one. I had sold it but the person who bought it returned it, saying that the lid lock was broken. The owner had not told me this. I checked and it was broken. I was upset that I didn't know this prior to placing the ad. Since the owner hadn't told me, I also wondered if I was going to be able to get him to pay the customer back. He agreed to refund the clients money himself, and allowing me to keep my commission for my effort. There was a table with lots of things sitting on it. I was gathering some of the items and sitting them in a shallow box. These were items that I was going to take home to try to sell. Someone started to help me and I said I only wanted the things that were cobalt blue, because I knew they would do well. I was talking to someone about the food processor, saying that it was a shame that the lid lock was broken because it was otherwise a great machine. We were talking about all of the things it would do, while using it to chop something. We just held the lid on snugly using a hand. A priest was there and had overheard our conversation. He asked me what I was going to do with it now. I asked him if he would like it and he very eagerly said yes, so I gave it to him. ",

This place has a lot of people in it (not this apartment, the whole building) and there's a lot of activity going on outside. It's maybe dusk. There's some sort of commotion outside. I'm near the front door anyway, trying out a key (yet another old key I've been handed - it's got 3 fronts to it, they're all scratched up and bent backwards but I couldn't see that at first). As I look at it I can see it won't work, and I see how soft the metal is and it breaks off and so I do that some more for fun. I'm talking to 2 guys at the same time. The noise outside sort of erupts, I think, and we go look. MB is here, too, and as we look over the wall of the outside walkway (we're upstairs) there's other people ding around. It reminds me of a movie scene of a Mongol camp or something - I might've seen cookfires and tent-tops if I'd looked around. Down below, there's a couple of cops all dressed in motorcycle gear with helmets and goggles, apprehending a couple of bad guys. One of the cops hits a bad guy just because he didn't like the way he looked, I guess, or he said something the cop didn't like. Anyway it was unwarranted. He had the guy by the collar and swung his arm way up and around and hit him in the face. I was appalled. I think he would have beaten up the guy if there hadn't been witnesses. I was feeling very disturbed, and thought I hadn't ever actually seen anything violent happen before. [Though that's not true.] While we're there, MB gets up on the wall rather clumsily, and I'm afraid she'll fall, which she does. I get rather upset at this, even though I know it's unlikely she'll get hurt, because there's so many people and things below. I call out to them to help her out. However, when I look over, I see there's some kind of awning not far down and she's on that, starting to climb back up. It's a struggle but she does it. Oh good. I'm relieved. We all go back in after the cops get ready to take the bad guys away. Inside is, I think, really Sue S.'s apartment, and she likes having company, she likes having movement and people doing things. We come here after a Training, for instance, to do LT tasks\/activities and be together. It varies, how many of us, and we come in and go out at intervals. I'm talking to a couple of people, one of whom is a pregnant blonde girl, who got that way because she's going with a guy that I'm in love with, which is rather frustrating for me. It certainly reinforces my self-consciousness. I'm feeling anxious, deprived, small, weak, pitiful. I go down the hall to Sue's room for some reason, can't remember what, but I don't want anybody to see me obviously poking around. I also want to spit, the way I do when I cough something up, and don't want anyone to see that. Someone (large, female, like Sabina) looks in at the door and says something, though, and I have to hold it. Starts to go away, I start to spit, she Dads back, etc. I give up.",

    "report":"I'm driving my car uptown in my hometown with an older man who's a psychologist who I can't think of, or rather I can't recall who he was, and someone else about my age whose name also escapes me. We park and have to go to a new building across the street, which is some sort of physics laboratory. It's raining. This older man has an umbrella, but this other boy and I run across the street in the rain. We run inside. They haven't quite completed work on the building yet. We get inside to this very large room. The ceiling is 50 ft. high or so and there are all sorts of people milling around in there talking. I'm looking for a girl, Joyce Reader, who is a girl I liked very much in early high school, but whom I haven't thought of in years. I'm wandering around looking for her in this big room, when bits of the plaster from the ceiling start to flake off and fall down. There's a horrible cracking sound and the crack spears in one wall, several times it extends itself, making a cracking sound each time And somebody said it was just a normal settling of a new building, but I get kind of worried and work my way around and get out of the room and run out of the building. While I'm doing this, the plaster starts falling off the ceiling in much greater quantities and people realize it's quite dangerous and they start getting out. Once I'm outside the building, the building seems to be the United Nations building instead of physics building. I'm trying to help report on the damage, and I'm talking to a couple of secretaries and describing to them what was happening inside. We decided we needed information about what was happening on the top of the building and I have a big wooden board, about 4 feet by 2 feet or something like that. I flopped this and tried to fly to the top of the building with it, but I can't get more than 2 feet or so off the ground in spite of a lot of muscular effort. The building is about 50 stories, so this isn't very practical. One of the secretaries tells me there's a lad on the 14th floor doing work on anti-gravity and go up there and get an anti-gravity unit, but not to tell anyone because this is strictly classified work. So I apparently go up the stairs or something and get to the 14th floor and get an anti-gravity unit from some female technicians who work there, and fly up to the top of the building and make a report, and also fly around and direct the people who are coming out so they don't get into traffic jams or panics. There's some intervening action I don't recall. Then I'm going back into the building, which has been repaired and is safe now, and I want to go back to the lab where I got the anti-gravity unit. I get into the elevator, which I had some difficulty finding because there were a bunch of lockers which kind of looked like elevator doors around, and I also noticed they had some separate corridors for Negroes, which bothered me. I get in the elevator and tell the operator 4th floor, and as it starts to stop, I realize I want the 14th, and I tell him that and we go on up. It's a rather dizzying ascent, which is quite fast. On the 14th I got out and I think the room is 213, and I go into 213 and that's not the place, so then I wander around to the east side of the building and find the laboratory. When I walk in, the first person is a big powerful man, and since this is classified and he doesn't know that I was there before, he pretends he doesn't know what I was talking about. Finally, I tell him not to worry because after I figured out how the unit worked, I destroyed the original one and so the secret wouldn't get out. I needed something else from the lab or something like that, but he told me I couldn't get into the lab. He slept right there in the entrance room and he would catch anybody that tried to get in. So then, just to show him that he shouldn't worry about the secret device getting out, I showed him a device I had in my pocket, which wasn't one of the anti-gravity type devices, but some other sort of gadget of no consequence, but I just slipped it out of my pocket and slipped into a little box and held it up to him and told him it was a new kind of anti-gravity unit. And I slipped it in my pocket and it proceeded to float in the air right in front of him. This convinced him that I had duplicated his own invention.",

The bus driver stopped to take his break 15 minutes before we were due to get into the city. A man had been sitting next to me on the bus. He was Spanish. I asked him where he was going and he said, \"Nicky.\" Later I realized what he meant was NYC (pronounced \"Nicky--\"C\" as in \"cat\"). We waited an awfully long time and the driver never came back. He had taken the bus keys. We were waiting in Aunt Jenny 's driveway. I knocked on the door, front. It was Lois who came to the door. She was busy. Bryan was not playing tennis. While waiting for the bus driver people began unpacking their lunches. There were pop tarts broken \"just right\" for a shoot. One was strawberry. One was apple. A girl brought out a chicken leg, fried, as big as a turkey leg, but it was a chicken leg. It was wrapped in many leaves of lettuce. I wondered what she did about the chicken bone. I said, \"You must be from California.\" And she said, \"No, I'm from near Denver, Colorado.\" I said, \"People in California eat lettuce.\" She said, \"We eat more lettuce in Colorado. We try to get all out vegetables at once. About half a head.\" Finally the bus driver came back and said, \"OK everybody, back on the bus.\" We were happy to be moving. We got as far as the gas station. Everyone shifted responsibility for who was going to pump. The gas was $1.29\/gallon. The driver went out and he never came back. We were sitting on the bus waiting. Eventually we were either air-lifted out or continued on boats through canals and floods. Some were large inflated rafts with paddles. Some are free (empty), waiting on the pier. I saw Dora. She wanted to hear the Mozart I'd been working on. She had barely chipped (her tooth) and the dentist fixed it lousy. I knew she could get it done right. I did NOT want to go to Say Smith's wedding\/birthday party. That crowd was too involved in the town's business.",

    "report":"Tom Cu and Mary Cu were moving to the city where I live. They asked me to go along with them to look at condos. They went to North Point Bay. I was telling them that I wished I still had my condo there, that I miss it. We actually looked at two different ones there. One of them I was lagging behind them when they left. I walked out just as the woman who owned it pulled into her driveway in a sports car. Some of her female friends were meeting her there. She gave me a look as if to say who are you and why did you just come out of my house. I got nervous for a moment because I didn't even see Tom Cu and Mary Cu anywhere around. But her friends just got in her car and they left. This one was extremely modern and either two or three floors. It was a very open floor plan with lots of red and chrome. I can't recall if the floors or the walls were red. The staircases were open with chrome banisters. It didn't seem to have much at all inside in terms of furnishings. We went to look at another one. It was very different. This one seemed to be more traditional looking on the inside and more of a first floor than second. It seemed almost cluttered with furnishings. The outside front yard of this one was great. They had built an arbor. It was beautifully landscaped. There were grassy areas and other things that I can't recall now that really attracted me to this one. We stayed inside this one for quite some time. We walked back and forth. While we were walking around we were talking about how excited I was that they were going to be living here and they were saying how excited they were that they would be able to see me so much more. I don't if we actually talked about this or if I just got this impression but it seems that I was going to be with them at least once a week, but likely more. We'd either be visiting each other or doing things together or I would just hang out at their condo. At separate times they had each given me a hug. It seems that another member of my family is there too but I can't recall for sure, or who it was. We went back outside and were just strolling around the front yard. They asked me which one I thought they should buy. I told them that of course I couldn't make that decision for them, but if it were me it would be no contest. They looked at me as though they didn't know which one I would select. So I said, something like, are you kidding? With this great front yard I would definitely pick this one. While pointing I mentioned a few of the specific features that I liked so well. One of them was the arbor over the entrance. Then I said, but then that's just me and my taste. ",

A woman goes in and she says, \"What a mess.\" I peek in and agree. I decide to wait. I walk on, looking for another one. I pass the orchestra and see a large carnival ride-like thing that swoops up and down and under it is a large water pond. There is a green alligator and wild cats that eat things. I think of going on the game and decide not to, those cats look vicious. I return the way I came and see a beautiful cello on the ground. I look more closely and ask the oriental man if that is a cello. He says, \"Yes.\" I say, \"It looked for a moment like a dulcimer, the color or type of wood, but I did think it was a cello.\" He smiles and then admires my skirt. It is a cotton wrap-around with designs and pictures that represent the history of Mexico. He is intrigued and bends down to look closely at the hem area. Suddenly, he rips off a section of the skirt and takes it. I am angry and say, \"Wait, you made a hole.\" He ignores me. I walk on, trying to decide what to do. I decide I'll go find a policeman and return to get that piece of my skirt from him. I look at the ramp on the right, thinking of going back that way, but it looks too long and I'd get tired. So I go back the way I came up to the original level. I see Nate and feel sad and wistful. His wife is nearby and I think she may be the owner of this mansion. He stands close to me and we chit chat, but we look at each other with longing. She stops by and chats and walks out the door. Nate is going with her and he pauses to say goodbye like to an acquaintance, but we stand close and I brush my hand over his just to touch. It is a tender, secretive moment. He goes out. I turn to rejoin the party. Now I want to go home, to the old M City house, but first the woman of the house (sort of Nate's wife) says, \"Why don't you take this carpet, for Charla.\" I agree and together we roll it up and she hands me pieces of tape and I wrap it around and around to secure the roll of carpet. Then Nate comes up and smiles gently and says, \"Why don't I help carry that for you.\" I know this means he'll come in and we'll be lovers again. I want to resist, sort of, but I don't. The woman steps away and Nate says, \"First, put this rose in my hair.\" He kneels like some ritual thing and I pluck a white rose or two from the table decoration and stand behind him to place the roses in the ponytail of long brown hair. It is touching and tender, and a ritual. I pat his head, maybe kissing it lightly. He says, \"Move the family thing.\" I look to the table and see a big plate of food on a holder warmer dish and realize he means to move the plate so he can put the carpet roll on it for a moment before he heaves it on his shoulder, and we walk down the road to the M City house and some alone time for ourselves to make love. The carpet is short and small.",

We do our trapeze act together, flying around and doing flips and turns in perfect synchronicity. The act is beauty in motion. When the act is over, we simply are together, loving, 24 hours a day. There is something about him having an affair with a woman and that hurt, but I just intensified my loving to such a degree, there was no time, thought or need for another, only me. Now we are getting married. I am in a beautiful white dress and as we are walking up the aisle. I whisper to him, \"I'm pregnant.\" He is thrilled and I am too, at peace. Now all is complete. I'm also a little amazed at the fact that I can get pregnant, because we're both so old. We spend months, maybe years together, and then he builds a bicycle, a special one that is fast and efficient. I set out on a bike trek, alone. It is for some reason important that I separate from Burt for a period of time, maybe to prepare for when he dies and I am left alone. So I pedal on down the highway. I stop at a gas station and while there, a man in a souped up flashy car with a yellow fringe top that has a smart mouth roars in, fills up and roars out. At first, I'm annoyed at his seeming insensitivity, his maleness and immaturity. Then I find it amusing and decide to try and catch up with him on my bike to observe him more. I pedal quickly and see a crowd stopped on a bridge observing something in the sky. I stop, because I have to, they block the road. I look up and see two rockets taking off, one chasing the other through the sky. It's a NASA launch and has something to do with relationships. I watch and then speed on my way, through the crowd to catch this man in the car. Next I'm on a freeway with cars and other bikers. I pass them all, feeling strong and fast. Now I've come to the river and see the other side. That's home, where Burt is and I miss him. I see I'll have to backtrack to get on the bridge and that will make me lose time finding that car. I then see an entrance ramp close by and pedal up it gathering speed to merge with car traffic. I speed across the bridge very confident and fast. I don't really care about the car anymore. I miss Burt. I stop at the other side at a book stall on the side of the road. I see a book that was given to me by Burt and I fall on the books, happy, rolling around in them like they were water. I want to buy them all and my daughter sees another book, only purchased here, that I'll want and she tries to buy them for me. I want to hurry back to my beloved Burt and happiness.",

When I've done that, [either she remarks on it or I notice with horror] that the spots are now a lot worse - in fact it looks like the cleaner has been eating away at the finish! There are a lot of bleached-looking spots in the middle. O dear, Geoffrey's not going to be pleased. I stare for a minute, then dash into the kitchen to find some wood polish. Geoffrey's standing next to the sink talking to another girl, and I grab the bottle of Pledge or something that's standing on the counter. I go back and polish the desk with it. Now what I see is these aren't spots on the finish at all, they're inlays or some design. As the polish restores the shine, the design becomes clear. (This is light wood on dark wood, like mahogany.) It's probably a Greek or Roman scene, somebody in a toga, animals maybe - I can't see the whole thing yet. I am a bit confused - I don't think this was visible before; does Geoffrey know about it? Will he like it when he does? Very odd, this visit, so far.",
